    Programming involves creating text files; these text files are typically
    too long or complex to be created in a single programming session (e.g.,
    a couple of hours). For example, a given website could contain 10 HTML 
    files, plus 2 CSS files, and 1 Js file, and it is usually unrealistic 
    to type them all in the same sitting session.
    
    Even if a given programming task (like creating a small website) was 
    small enough to create it in a single sitting, the programmer typically
    does not like the first version that she has created, so it usually creates
    a second version containing modifications, or additions, or deletions,
    of elements of the first version; and this process is repeated several
    times until the programmer likes the final result. For example, the first
    version of a website about Europe may be just a couple of HTMLs containing
    the work of the programmer in his first two hours of work before she goes
    for lunch, then the second version adds more information to those HTML
    files and contains, then the third adds some CSS files and the elements
    inside the HTML files needed to point to the CSS files, and then the
    fourth is the version existing when the programmer stops work for
    the day, then the fifth eliminates some information that now the programmer
    thinks is excessive, and then the sixth version eliminates typos, 
    then the seventh version adds a menu in some place, etc. 
    
    When a programming project has several versions like in the previous
    example, is is oftem useful to have an easy way to refer to previous
    versions of the project: for example, it is common to work on a given
    version during several days and then, due to a redesign, try to eliminate
    whatever was done in the last versions in order to go back to a
    previous one, and continue programming from there.

    It is also frequent to want to check a version that is several times previous
    to the current one, try some changes on top of that old one, and, if they
    are not satisfactory, discard them, and go back to the original, more advanced
    version.

    In theory, if the programmer is well organized in her job, she can zip
    all files of the project whenever she wants to create a version, and store
    the zip file in a separate folder giving it a descriptive name; then, whenever she wants to recover
    a previous version, she just grabs the corresponding zip file, unzips its
    contents in the main project folder, and work from there. And, if she
    ends up not being happy with whatever she does on top of that version,
    she can simply erase them, go back to the folder of zip files and then
    recover the zip file of the version she was working with, and continue from there.
    Each zip file acts as a snapshot of the project at a specific point in time.
    
    However, although using sepearate zip files is an acceptable option,
    the task of managing several versions of a project, being able to know
    how many versions we produced, and to know how they differ (i.e., which
    files they have, and which content are in those files, and the differences
    between any tow versions) is so common, that programmers have created tools
    specifically in charge of managing versions of groups of files used in programming projects.
    These are called <b>version control</b> systems. Sometimes they are also called
    source control because one of their main uses is to control versions 
    of source code (source code being what programmers type), apart from
    other types of files like photos, audio files, video files, etc.

    There are many source cotrol systems; the most popular nowadays is called
    <b>git</b>, and it is the one you are most likely to work with if you have
    a programming job. In this lession, we will learn the basics of git.

    If you are using Windows, go to google and type <b>git for windows</b>,
    and one of the first links will lead you to the website <b>https://git-scm.com</b>.
    Go there, download git, and install it; during installation you will be
    asked several questions; usually, there is a default answer that you will
    not need to change; however, the one that you should change is the one
    that will ask you <b>Which editor would you like Git to use?</b> or something
    like that: in this case, there is a default option that probably says 
    something like <b>Vim</b> (Vim is a text editor simpler than Notepad++ but a little
    more complex to use); in order to make your life easier, you shoulkd 
    choose instead Notepad++ if available, or Notepad; if no option other than
    the default one is available, leave it as it is (thid option selects
    the text editor that will, once you want to create a version of yourt
    project, let you write a description of what that version exacly contains,
    and this is handy because programmers tend to easily forget details
    about their programs, so git allows you to write any description you
    want when creating a version).

    There are many videos and webpoages about git in general, and installing
    git in windows in particular. Feel free to check any if you have any doubt.

    To check that git has been correctly installed, open a new command prompt (do not
    use one that was open before installing git, if you had any open); you open a command prompt by typing 
    Windows + R, and then typing <b>cmd</b> and then pressing Enter. Inside the command
    prompt, type <b><git --version</b>. If git isntalled correctly, you
    should see a message that says the version of git that you have installed.
    If, instead, you see an error saying that git has not been found, there
    was some installation error, and you will need to troubleshoot.
