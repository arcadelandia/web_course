Backups are fundamental for anybody that uses a computer to create any kind of data, including programs. Sometimes, people lose their laptops; this means that 
all data inside is lost, unless it was backed up somewhere. In addition, the entire contents of a folder can be accidentally erased; if
no backups exist, the contents are gone forever.
</p>
<p>
Thus, programmers, as everybody else, should make backups of their project files. One way to back 
  up a folder that contains a project, is to zip (i.e., compress into a single file) the folder; this is often done by right clicking 
  on the folder will usually show an option saying something
  like "Add to zip" or something like that). The resulting single file is then given a descriptive name, 
  and then stored in an online service that allows so (like Google Drive), or in a USB stick, or
emailed to an address, etc. Programmers can use this method, of course, for their projects. However,
for the specific case of programming projects, there are several companies that offer free storage services to programmers; these companies have
  computers always connected to the Internet whose sole purpose is to store programming projects created by anybody; these
  services are popular among programmers and among companies employing programmers because they 
  integrate nicely with the <em>git</em> tool that we saw in the previous lesson, which is used daily
  by most professional programmers. The companies offering these storage services are usually called
<em>git providers</em>, and there are many: github.com, gitlab.com, and bitbucket.org are some of the most well known. In this
lesson, we will see how to use <em>github.com</em> to store the backups of the programming projects that we create.
</p>
<ol>
  <li>Go to github.com and create an account.</li>
  <li>Create a folder in your computer Desktop for this lesson's exercise. Call it any name you want, for example, <em>lesson11</em></li>
  <li>Inside the newly created lesson11 folder, create a file (e.g., index.html) and put inside any content you want.</li> 
  <li>Open a command prompt window (Win+R, then cmd) and change to the lesson11 folder (typically by typing cd Escritorio/lesson11, or whatever name you need.</li>
  <li>Type <em>git init</em> 
  <li>Type <em>git add index.html</em> 
  <li>Type <em>git commit</em>
  <p>Just as a reminder, the previous three commands, as we saw in the previous lesson, create a .git folder inside the 
    lesson11 folder, and inside it a backup (also called a commit) is created, containing the state of the project up to that moment. 
    If you lose your laptop, you lose this backup. We will use github.com to store there a copy of our .git folder, so if we lose our laptop, we can recover the entire history of the project</p>
  <li>github.com, and other git providers, use the word <b>repository (or repo, for short)</b> instead of the word project; so now we
    are going to create a repository for your lesson11 project inside the github.com computers.  Thus, go to github.com, and create a new repository; call 
    it lesson11 (you can choose any name you want, but it is advisable to use the same name for your laptop project folder, and for the github.com name,
   in order to minimize confusion). It will ask you whether you want
  it to be public (so anybody in the entire Internet can go to github.com, explore the list of projects that people make public, and see your project) 
    or private (so only you can see the project, and any other github.com user that you specify). Select whatever option you want, and at the end
  it will show you some information, which will include a web address ending in .git, something like <em>https://github.com/arcadelandia/lesson11.git</em> 
    (but instead of seeing arcadelandia, you will see your username, and the name that you chose for this lesson, which is probably lesson11 if you did not
    decide to change it). This web address, which starts with <em>https://</em>, and ends in <em>.git</em>, is called a <b>remote</b> (because it is the address
    of a remote computer where you store ac opy of your stuff :)). For any existing repository, you can always see its git remote address by going to the
  main project page in github.com, clicking in the green button at the top right that says code (or something similar) and then you will be shown the remote address, among other things.</li>
  <p>The whole point of git is to make life easy for programmers; programmers often cannot easily decide how to do a given task; thus, they often create two or more versions
  of some file of a project (for example, a webpage about Spain with just only high-level information, and another version that is more detailed; only one of these will be
  finally used, but programmers are not really sure which one. So, they write both, and thus need to backup both until when the decision in favor of one or the other is made.
  git calls each of these alternatives a <b>branch</b>, and it allows programmers to give them any name. For example, in the example above, the names of the two branches could
  be <em>fewdetails</em> and <em>moredetails</em>, respectively, or anything else. So, in git, a branch is any of the multiple alternative versions of a project. At the start of the creation 
    of a project, and before any more branches are created, there is only one branch (the one with the files you create at the beginning), and git calls this unique branch by the
  name <em>main</em>, or <em>master</em>, although the latter one is not recommended as it has negative connotations.</p>
  <li>Type in the command prompt window that you opened before, <em>git branch -M main</em>. This changes the name of the branch you are working on, from master (the default), to main.</li>
  <li>Type in the command prompt window, <em>git remote add origin https://github.com/arcadelandia/lesson11.git</em>, where instead of the <em>https://github.com/arcadelandia/lesson11.git</em> part,
    you type the origin address that you copied in the step above (i.e., instead of arcadelandia, you put your github.com username; and, instead of lesson11 you sued another name,
    that other name that you decided to use). This tells the git program in your computer that, when trying to create a backup outside of
    your laptop, it needs to use github.com, and inside it, your account as indicated by your username (instead of arcadelandia), and inside it, the repository you just created (lesson11 in this case).
    The name <em>origin</em> is just a short name to refer to the remote address, and only used if you want to store your data in more than one remote computer, so we will
    not deal with that case here; when you only use a single remote computer (i.e., the one at github.com) the word <em>origin</em> is commonly used, but you can use any other.</li>
  <li>When doing a backup via github.com, you will need to use you github.com username, but not your password; you will need to create a special password used just 
    for copying your backups (and you can copy your backups as often as you want; many programmers do backups each few minutes). This special password is usually 
    called a token, and it usually has an expiry date that you decide when creating it (when the expiryn date is near, you need to create a new token
    and replace the previous one). To create this token, go to github.com, to your user icon, then 
    to Settings, then to Developer settings, then to Tokens(classic), then to Generate token, and then it will ask you for a short description of what
    you want it for (write somethinng, or a single word), and then click on "repo" (short for full access to any repositoiry, which is basically any project that you create). Then, click
    on Generate token, and it will show you in the screen that token (it is usually a long series of letters and numbers and perhaps symbols). 
    Copy it somewhere where you can access it later easily (e.g., in your email, or in a text file in your laptop, etc), 
    and when prompted for a password later, use it. If you forget it, or lose it, you can go to the same
    place to create a new one, and you can also delete the old one; it will expire after the time that you indicated before, and by default that time is 30 days, so after 30 days you will need to
    create a new one.</li>
  <li>Type in the command prompt window, <em>git push --set-upstream origin main</em>  This will maybe ask you for your username at github.com, so write
    it, and then for your password, and this means the token that you created before, not your github.com account password. This command tells
    git to use the remote named origin (the one at github.com) when creating a backup of the current branch (named main)</li>
  <li>Type in the command prompt window, <em>git push</em>. This will copy the current state of the project to github.com, creating a full backup. If it asks you again
    your username and password, use the username and token. In the future, after you are done with a work session and create a commit (typically several times an hour, 
    or several times a day), any time you want to copy a backup of the current state of your project to github.com, use the command <em>git push</em> from anywhere inside
  your project folder.</li>
  <li>If you lose your laptop, you can recover your project by grabbing from github.com your project; this is called <b>cloning</b> in git parlance. 
    To see how to do that, go to github.com, and go to your repository. You will see a green button saying something like "Code". Click on it,
    and you will see an option named clone, and inside the remote web address saying something like <em>https://github.com/arcadelandia/lesson11.git</em>.
    Then, in order to recuperate the entirety of that project, you just have to create in your new computer some folder to store it. To do that, create
    a folder in your desktop and name it recovertest, which will be empty; open a command prompt window (Win+X and then cmd), and change to the inside
    of that folder (e.g., doing cd Escritorio/recovertest, and then run <em>git clone https://github.com/arcadelandia/lesson11.git</em>. You will
  see that a new folder has been created with the name of yoiur repository (in this case, lesson11 inside your recovertest folder). If you go inside (cd lesson11), you will
  see the state of your project as it was when you just made the last backup (if you did any changes that you did not backup, those changes are lost forever unless you backed them
    up somewhere else). You can use git log to see all the commits that you did until that point. Congratulations! You may
  have lost your old laptop, but you still have your projects :)</li>
  <p>git is a tool that is heavily used by programmers during their workday; it also helps them to collaborate; it is very common that, when a project needs
    to be done by several programmers, all share the same github.com repo, and each programmer creates a branch with its own work, and all copy their branches
    each day to the same github.com repo, anmd periodically they use what is called a git merge to combine all those branches; this is already more
    advanced material, and you will get there on time. Don't forget to read beginner tutorials, and watch Youtube tutorials to learn how to use git. Have fun!</p>
