    The Internet is formed by a large group of computers that are able to exchange information, and by the communication links among them.
    The number of computers in the Internet is constantly changing as some computers are connected and disconnected to/from the Internet.
    The links among those computers are typically wireless, or optical fibers.

    Strictly speaking, the computers that form part of the Internet are those that are assigned what is called a public IP address. As these are
    expensive and scarce, usually only a few entities buy them: these entities are Internet Service Providers (ISPs, businesses that allow people
      to connect to the Internet), large government organizations, and large companies. The seller of the IP addresses is an entity named IANA, which
      works through delegation to other entities (RIPE for Europe and Middle East, ARIN for North America, AFRINIC for Africa, LAPNIC for Latin Anerica, APNIC for
      Asia Pacific). Once an entity buys a public IP address, it typically 
      configures it inside a given computer; that computer can thus be considered as being part of the Internet. However, there are many other 
      computers that also want to connect, but that do not have a public IP address. In order to allow a computer that does not have a public IP address 
      to connect to the Internet, it is given what is called a private IP address, which is a piece of configuration data that allows 
      that computer to communicate to another computer that has a public IP address, in order to ask that computer to exchange 
      information in its behalf.

    For example, a wireless ISP provider may have a router in a street in a city; that router has a public IP address, and thus can communicate
    with any other computer in the Internet (download websites, send emails, etc.). Several hundreds of smartphones of people living in that street
    get assigned private IP addresses by that street router, and thus each smartphone can only communicate with the street router rather than
      with other computers in the Internet; then, whenever a smartphone downloads a website, the smartphone is asking the wireless router 
      to download it in their name, which it does, while forwarding the data to the smartphone.
