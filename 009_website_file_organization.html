The smallest website that we may create has a single HTML file. This 
could be the case of a website that only has text, and no images, 
no videos, no CSS files, nr Javascript files. The website programmer
may decide to put all its textual content in a single HTML file.
</p>
<p>
However, in general a website will have many files. One of these will
be the main HTML file of the website (the one that users will initially
access with their brower to access the website); in addition, there may
be more HTML files. For example, a website about the countries of Europe
may have a main HTML file and an additional HTML file for each country.
In addition, each page may have images and/or videos. And in addition,
the website may have a style described in one or more CSS files. In addition,
the website may also have some kind of dynamic effect described in
one or more JS files.
</p>
<p>
When programmers create websites, they usually try to create a clean folder
structure to neatly organize all those files needed for a website. One
option is to put all archives in the same folder; however, this option
is typically frowned upon because many programmers consider that it does
not lead to a neat structure. As a result, some organization of files
in folders is usually needed.
</p>
<p>
Several conventions are common in order to organize the files of a website.
Let's describe them:
</p>
<p>
Filenames and folder names are usually lowercase; this applies to all parts 
of the filemane,including the extension, if any is present. For example, 
hello.html instead of HELLO.HTML or of Hello.html.
</p>
<p>
Filenames usually only contain English alphabet characters (so no tildes or
accents, etc). For example, espana.html instead of espa√±a.html.
</p>
<p>
The main HTML file of a website is called index.html, and is located at the
top of the folder structure created for the website.
</p>
<p>
The names of the folders should be given according to a logical pattern as chosen
by the programmer; for example, a common one can be according to the function
of the files in that folder: the HTML files may go in a folder named html,
the images and videos and sound files may go 
in a folder named multimedia, the CSS files in a folder called style,
and the JS files in a folder named js, etc. The programmer has total liberty
to choose these names, and to decide which files go where. The programmer
also, if she prefers, can create subfolders inside any folder if she thinks
that leads to an easier and neater folder structure: for example, if a website
about countries of Europe has a multimedia folder where images and videos are
put, but there are too many according to the tastes of the programmer (for example,
because they are hard to visualize in a explorer window or anything else), 
the programmer may create additional folders inside the multimedia folder, for
example, one per country; so there would be a multimedia/spain folder where
images for Spain would go, another folder named multimedia/france with
files for France, etc.
</p>
<p>
To sum up, a reasonable file and folder structure for any website is to
have a index.html file that will be the entry point to the website, a 
folder named style containing CSS files, a folder named js containing Javascript 
files, and a multimedia folder containing images, audio and video files.
</p>
<p>
When writing any HTML files, we will reference in various points the 
HTML, CSS, and Javascript files that also form part of the website, and
which are located in the folders and subfolders that we have created.
The HTML files will be referenced from the href attribute of the
a element; the CSS files will be referenced from the href attribute
of the link element, and the Javascript files will be referenced
from the src attribute of the script element. In addition, images
and video (and audio) files are referenced from the src property of
the img and source elements, respectively.
</p>
<p>
When writing a given HTML file that contains references to any 
other file inside our folder strucxture, we need to indicate
the path that the browser needs to follow, from the folder where
the HTML file being written is, to the folder where the desired
file is.
</p>
<p>
For example, imagine that we are writing a file named index.html
that will be the main entry point to a website about Europe. Besides
index.html, we have also created a folder named html to contain one HTML
file for each country (spain,html, portugal.html, france.html), and 
another folder named multimedia to contain
an image file for each country in Europe (spain.png, portugal.png,
france.png, etc.) 
</p>
<p>
If we want to show the image named spain.png from the file index.html,
we should not write
</p>
<p>
&lt;img href="spain.png"&gt;
</p>
<p>
because the browser will
try to find the image inside the folder where index.html is; however,
as the image is not there (it is inside the multimedia folder instead)
the browser will fail, and the image will not be shown to the user.
Instead, we need to write
</p>
<p>
&lt;img href="multimedia/spain.png"&gt;
</p>
<p>
in order to indicate that the image is inside a folder named multimedia.
</p>
<p>
When writing the file named spain.html in the folder named html, 
if we want to show the image called spain.png (which is located
in multimedia/spain.png) , we should not write
</p>
<p>
&lt;img href="multimedia/spain.png"&gt;
</p>
<p>
because the browser will try to locate a folder named multimedia
inside the html folder, and inside it to locate the image itself;
however, there is no folder named multimedia inside the folder named
html; instead, the folder multimedia is inside the parent folder of
the html folder: this is, the browser needs to go up one level
and there go to the multimedia folder, where the image is located.
That is written as
</p>
<p>
&lt;img href="../multimedia/spain.png"&gt;
</p>
<p>
The two dots mean to go up one level, and can be used as many times
as needed. 
</p>
<p>
Idem for the CSS and Javascript files: if there is a css file
named style.css inside the css folder, and the index.html
wants to include it; the programmer will type the following
in the index.html file:
</p>
<p>
&lt;link rel="stylesheet" href="css/style.css"&gt;
</p>
<p>
And inside the html/spain.html file we would write
</p>
<p>
&lt;link rel="stylesheet" href="../css/style.css"&gt;
</p>
</body>
</html>
