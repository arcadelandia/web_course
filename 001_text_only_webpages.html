HTML is a way to tell a web browser two things: 1) what information we want to show when
creating a webpage, and 2) how to represent it. This includes the text of the
page, plus any links to other pages that we want to inttoduce, plus
images, plus videos, plus buttons, plus forms to allow the viewers of the webpage
to input information, etc. These elements are collectively called hypertext. 

HTML does not care about whitespace. If we write a file with very long lines,
and another with very short lines, and another with several whitespaces between
words, and another with just one whitespace between words, the open them with
a web browser, the four files will be represented in the screen in exactly
the same way. If we want to control the presentation of the text, we will use
another language called CSS (that will be in a later lesson).

HTML is what is called a markup language, because it uses special words or
sequences of characters to instruct the browser how it should present the webpage to the viewer.
Each markup language uses its special words. HTML does too; for example, the 
markup word "b" (without quotes) means to bring the attention of the webpage reader 
to the text that follows (browsers usually interpret that by writing the text in bold); 
in a related example, the markup word "/b" means to stop bringing the attention of the reader (so, if the
browser was writing text in bold until that moment, it stops doing so). In HTML, the
"b" is called an opening markup word, and the "/b" is called a closing markup word.

In HTML, to tell the browser that we want to use a markup word, we enclose the word
inside the "less than" and "more than" symbols. For example, to use the markup
word "b", we would write it as: "<b>". This is needed because otherwise it would be\
impossible to write the letter "b" by itself in a document. For example, if we want
to write the list of four seasons, with the middle two written
in bold font, we would create an HTML document with 
the content: "spring <b> summer autumn</b> winter". The browser will write in the screen
the names of the four seasons, bolding the two middle words, and nothing else: it
and will not show in the screen neither "<b>" nor "</b>".

in another example, the markup word "em" means to emphasize the content that follows (browsers
usually do this by using italics); the markup word "/em" means to stop emphasizing the 
text. Markup words can be used at the same time; for example, if we want to write a phrase
in bold and italics at the same time, we would use the "b" "em" markup words together (in any order
we want), write the text that we want to write, and then use "/b" "/em" to tell the
browser to stop. When using several markups together, it is usually recommended to
write the closing markup words in reverse order to the opening one. For example, both the phrase
"spring <em> <b> summer autumn </em> </b> winter" and the phrase
"spring <em> <b> summer autumn </b> </em> winter" are correct, but the second is usually preferred
when creating HTML because the closing tags are in reverse order to the opening ones (this is, we
opened first with "em" and second with "b", and closed first with "b" and second with "em").

An HTML document is usually saved in a plain-text file whose name ends 
with either ".html" or ".htm", although ".html" is preferred. If we write any
other extension at the end, and we open that file with the web browser, the web browser will 
not interpret its contents as markup language, and will show instead the plain-text of the
page. For example, if we write "One <b> two </b>" in a file called "helloworld.html", the web browser
will show the word two in bold; however, if we call the file "helloworld.txt" and open it with
the browser, the browser will not do what the markup words say, and instead it will show them
in the screen.
