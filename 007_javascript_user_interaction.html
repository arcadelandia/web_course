<h1>Introduction to Javascript</h1>
<p>
Once a webpage has been created using HTML and CSS, its appearance in
the screen will usually not change: the text in is text elements (paragraphs,
  headers, lists) will remain as is; the color of the text and backgrounds 
  will too; same for images, video, forms, tables; the CSS grid that
  we designed to put the elements in, will remain unaltered as well. 
</p>
<p>
In some situations, modifying the content of the webpage is desirable: 
for example, we may want to connect periodically to some other
Internet webpage (e.g., our favorite news site), and grab some information
from it (e.g., the breaking news headlines) and print that information in some area of
our webpage. Or, we may want to allow the user to interact with the webpage in some
way: for example, using a button to allow the user to change the background color
of the webpage, or to add a paragraph with some information that the user has just written
in some textfield (like a post in Twitter), etc. Javascript is a language that is used for these
tasks involved in changing something in the webpage. These are sometimes 
called dynamic effects because they allow to change
the content and presentation of a webpage according to the logic that the
programmer wants. Webpages that use Javascript are thus sometimes
called dynamic webpages. In contrast, webpages that use just HTML and CSS are
called static webpages.
</p>
<p>
Javascript instructions are usually stored in text files with extension <b>js</b>.          
For example, a file named <b>example.js</b> would be a Javascript file.               
When we create an HTML file whose contents we want to control                
via Javascript, we need to tell the browser the path to the 
Javascript file that we want to use. We do this by means of the <b>script</b> element. Let's see it
  with an example: take a look at the following webpage, written in a file named
  <b>exampleForAzu.html</b>. This file defines four buttons, one that should
  change the webpage background color to red when clicked on, another to change
  it to green, another to blue, and another to white:
<pre>
&lt;!doctype html&gt;
&lt;html&gt;
  &lt;head&gt;
    &lt;title&gt;Azu is learning Javascript!&lt;/title&gt;
    &lt;script src="javascript4azu.js" defer&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
    &lt;link rel="stylesheet" href="css4azu.css"&gt;
  &lt;/head&gt;
  &lt;body&gt;
    &lt;input type='button' id="buttonForRed" value="Click here to change background to red"&gt;
    &lt;input type='button' id="buttonForGreen" value="Click here to change background to green"&gt;
    &lt;input type='button' id="buttonForBlue" value="Click here to change background to blue"&gt;
    &lt;input type='button' id="buttonForWhite" value="Click here to change background to white"&gt; 
  &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
</pre>
<p>
In the above HTML file, we declare the doctype (which indicates that we intend
to use standard HTML), then the html element that contains the whole webpage, and inside
it, two elements: the element head, and the element body.
The element head, as we saw in previous lessons, contains information that is not directly
  shown to the user: in this example they are the title,
  a <b>script</b> element that indicates that we want to use a file named javascript4zu.js with
  Javascript code that we will use to make sure that the buttons allow to change the background color; and 
  a <b>link</b> element referencing a CSS file named css4zu.css that would contain style instructions.
  Then, the element <b>body</b> contains everything that
will be shown to the user in the webpage: in this example, it is just four
buttons. We gave a unique ID to each one: the first button has an id of <b>buttonForRed</b>, 
and on it we write the phrase "Click here to change background to red"; when the user clicks
on it, we want the background color of the entire webpage to turn to red; we will do that using code
that we will write inside the Javascript file. The other three buttons are similar: one 
  uses green, another blue, and the last one, white, which is usually the default color of any webpage background.
</p>
<p>
  One important aspect of the <b>script</b> element is that it has a closing tag, and that nothing is written
  between the opening tag and the closing tag. This is in contrast to the <b>link</b> element
  that we use to indicate a CSS file, which does not have a closing tag.
</p>
<p>
The <b>script</b> opening tag has the optional attribute <b>defer</b>, which means that we want the browser
  to finish downloading the entire html file before attempting to process the Javascript file (i.e., the browser
  <em>defers</em> the processing of the javascript file until the html file has been downloaded).
  In general, it is recommended to write it, due to the following: the browser starts reading the html file
  at the beginning of the file, and processes it line by line. Take a look at the example: first, the browser
  processes the doctype, and then the opening tags
  of the html and head elements. Then, the title element, and then the script element referencing the
  Javascript file. Then, before continuing processing the link element that appears in the next line, it reads the entire Javascript file,
  and only when it finishes processing the Javascript file it will continue processing the html file, starting
  with the link element, then the closing head tag, and then the body element. The important part to notice here is that
  when the browser reads the Javascript file, it still did not read the four buttons that the Javascript file will manage (and
  that is because they are written in the html file AFTER the Javascript file). And, since the whole point of the Javascript file
  is to control those four buttons, the browser may get confused if we attempt to do anything
  related to those buttons inside the Javascript file. To make sure that the browser knows about the existence
  of the buttons when we try to control them with Javascript, it is better to <b>defer</b> the reading of the
  contents of the Javascript file until the entire HTML file has been processed (so the browser has alredy
  seen the buttons and everything else inside the webpage). That is why we write defer in the script opening tag.

<h1>Javascript Vocabulary</h1>
<p>
 Now let's see how to write the Javascript file <b>example4azu.js</b>. Let's start with 
  some <b>Javascript vocabulary and grammar</b>.
</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    The word <b>document</b> in lowercase means the entire webpage. NOTE: Javascript, in contrast to HTML and CSS,
    is case sensitive: the words document, Document, dOcUmEnT, etc., are all different.
  </li>
  <li>
    A dot between two words without spaces ---like in <b>totoro.tail</b>---- means that whatever 
    word is on the right of the dot is applied to whatever is on the left. In the example before, that means the tail
    of the entity called totoro. You can think of the dot between two words as
    an apostrophe s in English.
  </li>
  <li>
    The expression <b>document.body</b> means all the HTML elements that we write inside the <b>body</b> tag
    in the HTML file.
  </li>
  <li>
    The word <b>getElementById</b> followed by a string between parentheses, like in <b>getElementById("buttonForRed")</b>
    means the HTML element whose id is the word in the parentheses. In the example HTML file above (the one called exampleForAzu.html)
    it would be the button whose id is buttonForRed.
  </li>
  <li>
    The word <b>style</b> means the set of CSS styling attributes of an HTML element, like color, background color, padding, etc.
  </li>
  <li>
    The word <b>backgroundColor</b> means the background color of some element. It is usually used jointly with the style keyword,
    like in <b>style.backgroundColor</b>.
  </li>
  <li>
    The equal sign is used to assign something a value. For example, the following would change the background color of the
    HTML element called "buttonForRed" to pink:
    <pre>
    document.getElementById("buttonForRed").style.backgroundColor = "pink"
    </pre>
    The above is read by the browser as: "get the document, and inside it the element whose id is buttonForRed, and from its
    style properties, change the background color to pink".
  </li>  
  <li> 
    In Javascript, any word or series of words that isntruct the browser to do something is called an statement. For example,
    </b>document.getElementById("buttonForRed").style.backgroundColor = "pink"</b> is an statement because it tells the
    browser to do something. Is is customary, although not mandatory, to write a semicolon after each statement in Javascript,
    For example, instead of 
    <pre>
     document.getElementById("buttonForRed").style.backgroundColor = "pink"
    </pre>
    it is recommended to write
    <pre>
    document.getElementById("buttonForRed").style.backgroundColor = "pink";
    </pre>
  </li>
  <li>
    In Javascript, any word or words that have any value is called an expression. For example, the word
    <b>document</b> is an expression; the series of words
    <b>document.getElementById("buttonForRed").style.backgroundColor")</b> is also an expression;
    the word <b>"pink"</b> is also an expression too.
  </li>
  <li>
    Javascript expressions are somewhat equivalent to anything that can be the subject in a normal language like English
    or Spanish. Javascript statements are equivalent to complete sentences with a verb that indicates an action. <br>
    For example,
    <b>document.getElementById("buttonForRed").style.backgroundColor")</b> means "the background color of the element
    named buttonForRed", which can be the subject of an English sentence. The word <b>"pink"</b> can also be the
    subject of an English sentence. The complete expression 
    <pre>
      document.getElementById("buttonForRed").style.backgroundColor = "pink";
    </pre>
    is equivalent to a complete English sentence because it involves an assignment, which means "CHANGE to pink the
    background color of the element whose id is buttonForRed".
  </li>
  <li>
    The word <b>innerHTML</b> means whatever is written in between
    the opening and closing tags of a given HTML element. For example, if we have 
    a paragraph written like this: <b>&lt;p&gt;Hola caracola&lt;/p&gt;</b>,
    then its innerHTML woul be <b>Hola caracola</b>. This is, everything written between 
    the opening and closing <b>p</b> tags will be
    its innerHTML.
  </li>
  <li>
    To append some text to a HTML text element, like a paragrap, or a list item, 
    Javascript uses a plus sign followed, without spaces, by an equal sign, followed by the text
    to be appended. For example, the following code appends a phrase
    to the element whose id is <em>parrafoSobreBurgos</em>:
    <b>document.getElementById("parrafoSobreBurgos").innerHTML += " El cuento de la buena pipa."</b>
  </li>
  <li>
    Javascript can be used to tell the browser to do something when a condition of some kind occurs. For example, imagine that we
    want to do something like this: <em>when the user clicks in the button whose id is "curiousButton", then
    change the color of the background of the webpage to blue, and the color of the font of the text of all elements to red,
    and <b>append</b> the phrase <b>Burgos has a town.</b> to the paragraph whose id is "parrafocastilla", and <b>replace</b> the text of the
    paragaph whose id is "parrafogalicia" for the phrase "Galicia has four provinces.</em>
   
    In Javascript, any group of actions that we want to do one after the other is called a function. The Javascript programmer
    is free to choose a name for any function. A function is indicated by the word <b>function</b>, followed by
    the chosen name for the function, two parentheses, and the actions to be done written inside braces. It is usual
    to write one action per line. In the example above, we would write:
    <pre>
    function cosas_que_hacer_al_pulsar_el_boton() {
      document.body.style.backgroundColor = blue;
      document.body.style.color = red;
      document.getElementById("parrafocastilla").innerHTML += "Burgos has a town.";
      document.getElementById("parrafogalicia").innerHTML = "Galicia has four provinces.";
    }
    </pre>
    Observe the difference between how we use <b>+=</b> and <b>=</b>: the former appends text to the existing text, 
    and the latter replaces the existing text for new one. Take care with not confusing them.
   </li>
</ol>
</ul>
