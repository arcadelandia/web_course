Hi Azu!

We are going to learn how to use CSS, a lenguage that controls how the elements
of a HTML webpage are presented.

CSS is a language that allows us to tell the browser that we want to change the
default behavior that it used to present HTML content. Its name means
cascading style sheets: an style sheet is a set of attributes without semantic
meaning and their corresponging values (font color and size, margin size, etc):
For example, a style sheet can say that paragraphs must be written in a blue font
over a yellow background. Cascading means that a HTML page can use several style 
sheets at the same time, and any potential conflicting instructions can be resolved
in a reasonable manner: for example, if one style sheet says that font color should be
blue, and another that it should be red, the browser has some reasonable rule
to determine which one, if any, should be the final one.

HTML, as we have seen until now, allows us to define some elements by means of
tags: we use a <b>&lt;p&gt;</b> to indicate that we want to write a paragraph,
a <b>&lt;h1&gt;</b> for a heading, a <b>&lt;ul&gt;</b> for an unordered list, etc.
Those tags tell the browser the kind of information that we want to provide: when
we use <b>&lt;p&gt;</b>, the browser will automatically put more space with respect
to whatever we were writing before; when we use <b>&lt;ul&gt;</b> the browser
prepares to print a list of items in vertical; when we use <b>&lt;h1&gt;</b>
the browser uses a large font and usually writes the content in bold. 

By default, all the elements that we write in the HTML file are presented in
the browser in the same order in which we wrote them in the HTML file.

CSS allows to avoid the vertical presentation of items, by placing elements in
other orders: for example, if we write in HTML an ordered list of links to pages,
the browser will write it immnediately below of what we were writing before.
However, with CSS we can tell the browser to put it somewhere else: for example,
to put it to the left of the window, preventing any oter content to share that
left space: this would turn that ordered list into a navigation menu of the kind that is
common in many websites. We can also use CSS to put it in the right of the page, or
on the top, or on the bottom.

We can also use CSS to indicate the size of margins of elements, whether we
want borders around them and with which styles (dashed, solid, dotted, etc.), font
colors, font sizes, background colors, font families and styles (underlines, overlines,
with a line through the text, cursive, bold, bold size, etc.). 

CSS also allows control over the shape and color of the mouse cursor when it hovers
over a given element (for example, change the cursor from an arrow to a dot when
hovering over a given image, etc.).

There are too many properties that allow to be modified in CSS to cite them here. For
a good introduction to them, search Google for "CSS MDN". MDN stands for Mozilla Development
Network.
