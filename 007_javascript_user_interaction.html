Javascript is a language that is used to tell the browser                      
 what to do with the HTML elements that we write in the html files              
 and how to modify them, delete them, or create them, if needed.                
 For example, if we want to put a button that, when pressed, allows             
 to change the background color of the page, we would use Javascript;           
 or, if we want to move an image from the center of the page to                 
 the left of the page when the user moves the mouse over it (like in            
 a game of cat and mouse), we would use also Javascript. Or, if                 
 we want to connect to another website each minute to download some             
 information (for example, news headlines from the webpage of a given           
 newspaper), and then present that information in a new paragraph               
 in the main body of our webpage, we would use Javascript.                      
                                                                                
 Javascript instructions are stored in text files with extension "js".          
 For example, a file named example.js would be a Javascript file.               
 When writing an HTML file whose content we will like to control                
 via Javascript, we need to indicate to the browser                             
 the path to the javascript file that we want to use, in the following          
 way:>                                                                          
 <script src="whatever-path-to-the-js-file" defer></script>                     
 where the src attribute contains the path to the location of the               
 js file, and the attribute "defer" means that you want the browser             
 to wait (i.e., defer further action) until it has downloaded                   
 the entire webpage before running                                              
 whatever instructions you have put in the Javascript file. This is             
 not strictly needed, but it is a good idea                                     
                                                                                
 For example, if you see the following code in an HTML file                     
 <title>Example</title>                                                         
 <html>                                                                         
 <link src="thingies/stuff/stylenumber1.css">                                   
 <link src="thingamajig/someweirdstyle.css">                                    
 <script src="morestuff/something.js" defer></script>                           
 <script src="blabla/prrr/something2.js"></script>                              
 <script src="interestingeffectsjs" defer></script>                             
                                                                                
 that means that:                                                               
 1) the html webpage will get its CSS instructions                              
 from two files: one named stylenumber1.css that is inside a folder named       
 stuff that is inside a folder named thingies, which is in the same             
 folder as the html file itself; and another named someweirdstyle.vss           
 located in a folder named thingamajig that is in the same folder as the        
 html file                                                                      
 2) the html webpage will get its Javascript instructions from three            
 files:                                                                         
  a) one located in a file named something.js located in a folder named         
     morestuff located in the same folder as the html file                      
     and whose instructions need to wait to be executed until the browser       
     has finished downloading all the page info,                                
  b) from another named something2.js located in a folder named                 
     prrr which is inside a folder named blabla located inside the same         
     folder as the html file, and whose instructions do not need to wait        
     until the downloading of the HTML file (because it does not have the       
     defer attribute), and thus would be executed immediately once the          
     browser sees that line in the HTML file, and                               
  c) from another called interestingeffects.js located inside the same          
     folder as the HTML file, and whose instructions need to wait until         
     the browser has finished downloading the entire html webpage.              
                                                                                
 In general, a html file will only include one css file, and one Javascript     
 file.                                                                          
                                                                                
 Let's see how to use the Javascript language to command the browser            
 to do something that we want it to do.                  
   
  In Javascript, the word Document means the entire webpage:                     
Document                                                                        
 In Javascript, the expression Document.getElementById("holaazu") means to      
 get the Document, and inside it (the dot means to go inside), get              
 the HTML element with the id "holaazu". That element could be                  
 a paragraph, a header, a list, an image, a div, etc.). For example,            
Document.getElementById("bocadillo")                                            
 means to get the element whose id is "bocadillo". If that element does         
 not exist, then the browser will not do anything. Otherwise, it will           
 do whatever we indicate later.                                                 
 For example, imagine that we want to create a webpage with three               
 buttons:                                                                       
 1) one with the id redbutton, with the text 'Pulse here to change to red'      
    and that, when the user clicks on it, the background color of the           
    entire webpage changes to red.                                              
 2) one with the id greenbutton, with the text 'Pulse here to change to green'  
    and that, when the user clicks on it, the background color of the           
    entire webpage changes to green.                                            
 3) one with the id bluebutton, with the text 'Pulse here to change to blue'    
    and that, when the user clicks on it, the background color of the           
    entire webpage changes to blue.                                             
 When any page loads, the background color is white, because                    
 that is color that most browsers use by default. We use these three            
 buttons to change the background color. In order to tell the                   
 browser to change the background color to red when a user clicks it,           
 we write in the Javascript file as follows:                                    
                                                                                
Document.getElementById("redbutton").onclick = change_to_red_background;        
function change_to_red_background() {                                           
  Document.body.style.backgroundColor = "red";                                  
}                                                                               
 The first line has an equal sign. Lines with an equal sign are                 
 easier to understand by reading the left part backwards, and then              
 the right part. So, in this example, we can read that line as:                 
 when the user clicks (indicate via the word 'onclick', which is a              
 special word in the Javascript language that means 'a user clicks')            
 on the element whose id is redbutton (indicated via the word getElementById    
 and the label 'redbutton' that we freely assigned to the button inside         
 the html file) inside the webpoage (indicated via the word Document, which     
 means the webpage in Javascript), then execute the instruction named           
 change_to_red_background, which is a name that we just invented. This          
 invented name is called a function, and it basically is a series of            
 Javascript sentences that we need to create in order to do whatever            
 it is that we want to do when the user clicks in the button: in this           
 case, it is changing the background color to red. We selected the              
 name change_to_red_backrgound because it is expressive of what the             
 function does, which is the recommended way (however, it could have            
 any other name, like function123, or tonto_el_que_lo_lea, and it               
 would be correct as well; however, it is considered a good programming         
 practice to use names that are expressive of what the function does, and       
 that usually means using a verb followed by distinctive characteristics:       
 in this case: change_to_red_background. The choice of separating the           
 words via underscores is optional; each programmer has its own style:          
 a common option is camel case, like: changeToRedBackground. Use whatever       
 you prefer.                                                                    
 So, the first line tell the browser "when a user clicks on the element         
 whose id is redbutton, do the instructions contained in the function           
 named change_to_red_background". So now, the only thing remaining is           
 to create that function and use to tell the browser to change the              
 page background color to red. That is done by the lines:                       
 function change_to_red_background()                                            
  Document.body.style.backgroundColor = "red";                                  
 }                                                                              
 The first tells Javascript that we are about to say what is exactly            
 the change_to_red_background function that we referenced before.               
 The function can be anywhere in the Javascript document, it does               
 not have to be following the line with the onclick isntruction.                
 The function is defined with the word function, then the name that             
 we selected, two parentheses that may not have anything between them,          
 or may have something (we will see that later), and then the function          
 instructions between braces {}                                                 
 In our case, the function istructions is just a single one because             
 Javascript allows us to change the background of the webpage with              
 just a single instruction:                          
   Document.body.style.backgroundColor = "red";                                    
 This line means that "red" will be the background color of the body            
 element of the HTML page (the body is the entire visible area                  
 of the webpage, and is indicated with the tag <body> in the HTML file,         
 although taht tag is optional, because the browser will act as if it           
 is written even if we do not write it).                                        
                                                                                
                                                                                
                                                                                
 <button id="cambiaazul" value="click me to see what happens!">                 
 and then you                                                                   
 For example, imagine that we have a webpage about provinces in                 
 Castilla, in such a way that there are nine paragraphs, each one               
 with an id equal to the name of the corresponding province. This               
 means that somewhere in the html there is a <p id="leon">                      
 there is a <p id="zamora">, etc. Imagine                                       
                                                                                
 which would tell the browser that we want to do something (yet unspecified)    
 with the element whose id is cocodrilos. If we did not write that element,     
 the browser will no do anything. A common error in Javascript is to            
 mispell the id of an element, so care should be taken when writing them        
                                                                                
                                                                                
 Using a dot means 'go inside': for example,                                    
  "a.b" (without the quotes) means: take a, and inside it, 'b'                  
 for example,                                                                   
Document.getElementById("cocodrilo")
