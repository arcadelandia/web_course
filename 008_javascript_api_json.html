Websites basically present data to their users. Most of the websites we interact with have data 
geared towards a human being: HTML to categorize information, and CSS to make its presentation
nice for a human viewer.

There are websites that inted to make their data easy to access, not to humans, but also to
computers. The main difference between humans and computers is that computers are not as good
as humans to search for a given piece of information if it is in the middle of more data. For
example, it is reasonably easy for a human to look at a photo and try to see if there is
something in that photo (for example, a fruit on top of a book); a computer has a much harder
time doing that. As a result, when website data is targeted towards being used by a computer,
or by a program running in a computer, its data tends to be made available in a format that
makes it easy for the computer to make sense of it. There are many ways to do this. A popular
way to do this is by using a language called JSON. 

JSON is short for Javascript Object Notation, and it was designed to make it easy for Javascript
programs to deal with website data. In theory, a Javascript program can download a HTML page in the
same way as a human would, but HTML is a format designed to structure data for humans. JSON attempts
to structure data for computers.

Most JSON files are used to represent sequences of attributes with values, which often represents
objects from the real world. As a result, these collections of attributes with values are called objects.
An attribute together with its value is also called a property. For example, we can represent a given orange fruit
with a JSON object, with an attribute called <b>weight</b> whose value is <b>100g</b>, and an attribute 
called <b>color</b> which can be <b>orange</b>, an attribute called <b>bittenByABug</b> whose
value may be <b>some people say yes, some people say no</b>, and an attribute called
<b>numberOfButsLivingInside</b> whose value is <b>35</b>. We are free to put any number of
attributes to an object, and to give any value that we wish to those attributes. The JSON way to
represent this orange object would be:
<pre>
 {
   "weight": "100g",
   "color": "orange",
   "bitenByBug": "some people say yes, some people say no",
   "numberOfBugsLivingInside": 35
 }
</pre>
The presence of blank spaces is irrelevant outside of the inside of quotes. For example, the above example file
is the same as the following one:
<pre>
{"weight":"100g","color":"orange","bitenByBug":"some people say yes, some people say no","numberOfBugsLivingInside":35}
</pre>
When presenting JSON files for human reading, those spaces are often used to make it prettier.

Objects are represented betweeen brackets, with their properties separated by commas, and where
each property has an attribute name written between quotes, and an attribute value that either
is an integer name (which may be written without quotes), or a piece of information of any kind (which
must be written inside quotes). There are some other types of values but we will see them later.

JSON files can also have collections of objects. These collection of objects are called arrays,
and are written between square brackets. For example, if we have a box with three objects: an apple, an strawberry,
and a beach ball, we can represent those contents as:
<pre>
[
 {"weight": "80g", "isFruit": "yes", "fruitType": "apple", "color": "green", "isItMine": "yes"},
 {"weight": "20g", "isFruit": "yes", "fruitType": "strawberry", "isItMine": "maybe", "willIEatItSoon": "hopefully so"},
 {"weight": "400g", "isFruit": "no", "description": "beach ball", "isItMine": "no", "color": "blue", "texture": "plastic"},
]
</pre>

Many websites offer JSON files to get information intended to be used by a computer program. For example,
this one returns the weather in a given city.
