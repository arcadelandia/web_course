Backups are fundamental for anybody that uses a computer. Sometimes, people lose their laptops; this means that 
all data inside is lost, unles it was backed up somewhere  In addition, the entire contents of a folder can be accidentally erased; if
no backups exist, the contents are gone forever.

Thus, programmers, as everybody else, should make backups of their project files. Folders are typically zipped in a single file,
which is then given a descriptive name, and then stored in an online service that allows so (like Google Drive), or in a USB stick, or
emailed to an address, etc. Programmers can use any of those options as well, of course, for the files in their projects. However,
for the specific case of programming projects, there are several companies that offer free storage services in their computers, and
these storage services integrate nicely with the <em>git</em> tool that we saw in the previous lesson. These are usually called
<em>git providers</em>, and there are many: github.com, gitlab.com, and bitbucket.org are some of the most well known. In this
lesson, we will see how to use <em>github.com</em> to store the backups of the programming projects that we create.
