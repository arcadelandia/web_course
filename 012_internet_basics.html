    The Internet is formed by a large group of computers that are able to exchange information, and by the communication links among them.
    The number of computers in the Internet is constantly changing as some computersa are connected and disconnected to/rom  the Internet.
    The links among those computers are typically wireless, or optical fibers.

    Strictly speaking, the computers that form part of the Internet are those that are assigned what is called a public IP address. As these may be
    expensive and scarce, there is a mechanism that gives other computers what is called a private IP address, which is a mechanism that allows to
    communicate with another computer that has a public IP address, in order to ask that computer to exchange information in the behalf of the
    computer with the provate IP address.

    For example, a wireless ISP provider may have a router in a street in a city; that router has a public IP address, and thus can communicate
    with any other computer in the Internet (download websites, send emails, etc.). Several hundreds of smartphones of people living in that street
    get assigned a private IP address by that street router when they are switched on; and whenever a smartphone downloads a website, the smartphone
    asks the wireless router to download it in their name, and then to send the website to the smartphone. This is done this way becuase the ISP
    needs to pay an organization called IANA for having public IP addresses.
