<title>Azu's web course: Lesson 5: Controlling presentation with CSS</title>
<p>
Hi Azu!
</p>
<p>
We are going to learn how to use CSS, a progamming language that controls how the elements
of a HTML webpage are presented.
</p>
<p>
CSS is a programming language that allows to tell the browser how to change its
default behavior when presenting HTML webpages to users. Its name is an acronym
for "cascading style sheets": an style sheet is a set of attributes without semantic
meaning and their corresponging values (font color and size, margin size, etc):
For example, a style sheet can say that paragraphs must be written in a blue font
over a yellow background. Cascading means that a HTML page can use several style 
sheets at the same time, and any potential conflicting instructions can be resolved
in a reasonable manner: for example, if one style sheet says that font color should be
blue, and another that it should be red, the browser has some reasonable rule
to determine which one, if any, should be the final one.
</p>
<p>
HTML, as we have seen until now, allows us to define some elements by means of
tags: we use a <b>&lt;p&gt;</b> to indicate that we want to write a paragraph,
a <b>&lt;h1&gt;</b> for a heading, a <b>&lt;ul&gt;</b> for an unordered list, etc.
Those tags tell the browser the kind of information that we want to provide: when
we use <b>&lt;p&gt;</b>, the browser will automatically put more space with respect
to whatever we were writing before; when we use <b>&lt;ul&gt;</b> the browser
prepares to print a list of items in vertical; when we use <b>&lt;h1&gt;</b>
the browser uses a large font and usually writes the content in bold. 
</p>
<p>
By default, all the elements that we write in the HTML file are presented in
the browser in the same order in which we wrote them in the HTML file.
</p>
<p>
CSS allows to avoid the vertical presentation of items, by placing elements in
other orders: for example, if we write in HTML an ordered list of links to pages,
the browser will write it immnediately below of what we were writing before.
However, with CSS we can tell the browser to put it somewhere else: for example,
to put it to the left of the window, preventing any oter content to share that
left space: this would turn that ordered list into a navigation menu of the kind that is
common in many websites. We can also use CSS to put it in the right of the page, or
on the top, or on the bottom.
</p>
<p>
We can also use CSS to indicate the size of margins of elements, whether we
want borders around them and with which styles (dashed, solid, dotted, etc.), font
colors, font sizes, background colors, font families and styles (underlines, overlines,
with a line through the text, cursive, bold, bold size, etc.).
</p>
<p>
CSS also allows control over the shape and color of the mouse cursor when it hovers
over a given element (for example, change the cursor from an arrow to a dot when
hovering over a given image, etc.).
</p>
<p>
There are too many properties that allow to be modified in CSS to cite them here. For
a good introduction to them, search Google for "CSS MDN". MDN stands for Mozilla Development
Network.
</p>
<p>
CSS instructions are written in one or more files. Those files are usually named with ".css" extension.
To tell the browser to apply the instructions found in a file named "aeiou.css" 
file to a given HTML file, we write anywhere in that HTML file the following:
<pre>
&lt;link rel="stylesheet" href="aeiou.css"&gt;
</pre>
</p>
<p>
Inside the css file, we write instructions that will tell the browser how to
modify the appearance and presentation in the screen of the content of the
HTML webpage. There are three main instruction types to do that inside the CSS file:
<ul>
<li>If we want to control all elements with a given tag name (for example, we
  we want all paragraphs to use a blue font, and a red background) we write: 
  <b>tagname {property1: value1; property2: value2; ... ; propertyN: valueN;}</b>
where tagname is the name of the tag whose appearance we want to control, propertyX is the
name of the property that we want to control, and valueX the value for that property.
For example, to tell the browser that elements with tag <b>p</b> should have blue font
  over yellow background, we would write:
<pre>
p {
   color: blue; 
   background-color: red;
}
</pre>
</li>
<li>
  If we want to apply some instructions to a specific element, we need to identify it
  by an unique name inside the HTML code, and then refer to that unique identifier in the
  CSS file. In order to give unique names to elements in the HTML code, we use the attribute id
  inside the opening tag of an element. For example, the following:
  <pre>
   &lt;p id="spain"&gt;Spain is in Europe. It borders the Atlantic Ocean.&lt;/p&gt;
  </pre>
  defines a paragraph with the identier "spain". Idenfiers are case sensitive, and must be unique
  inside the HTML document. Since it has an identifier, we can write this in the CSS file:
  <pre>
   #spain {
      color: yellow; 
      background-color: red;
      text-decoration: underline;
   }
 </pre>
  And in this way, the paragraph identified as "spain" would have yellow font over a red baclground,
  and its text is underlined. In addition, if the CSS file also indicated that paragraphs should be
  written in blue font, the instructions for the paragraph whose id is "spain" would override the
  instructions for all paragraphs.
</li>
  <li>
    If we want a lot of elements in a HTML page, but not all, to have a common appearance, in theory
    we can put a different id to each of them, and then indicate, for each one, how we want them to
    appear. For example, if we have a HTML page where we have a paragraph for each country in the
    world, and we want to use a different color for the countries of a given continent, 
    then we would have 193 paragraphs: 43 would be for countries in Europe, 35 for America,
    54 for Africa, 47 for Asia, and 14 for Oceania. We can give a unique id for each one in the HTML
    file (whose value can be, for example, the name of that country), by:
    <pre>
     &lt;p id="spain"&gt;Spain is square.&lt;/p&gt;
     &lt;p id="portugal"&gt;Portugal is rectangular.&lt;/p&gt;
     ...
     &lt;p id="japan">Japan is long.&lt;/p&gt;
     &lt;p id="china">China is rectangular.&lt;/p&gt;
     ...
     &lt;p id="morocco">Morocco has the Atlas.&lt;/p&gt;
     &lt;p id="algeria">Algeria is big.&lt;/p&gt;
     ...
     &lt;p id="canada">Canada is cold.&lt;/p&gt;
     &lt;p id="usa">USA is rectangular.&lt;/p&gt;
     ...
     &lt;p id="austalia">Australia is big.&lt;/p&gt;
     &lt;p id="newzealand">New Zealand has two islands.&lt;/p&gt;
    </pre>
    and then, in the CSS file, we would
    have 193 repetitions of the kind:
    <pre>
      #spain {color: blue; background-color: white; font: 2em; font-family: arial; }
      #portugal {color: blue; background-color: white; font: 2em; font-family: arial; }
      ...      
      #japan {color: red; background-color: green; font: 2em; font-family: arial; }
      #china {color: red; background-color: green; font: 2em; font-family: arial; }
      ....
      #morocco {color: blue; background-color: green; font: 2em; font-family: arial; }
      #algeria {color: blue; background-color: green; font: 2em; font-family: arial; }
      ....
      #canada {color: red; background-color: blue; font: 2em; font-family: arial; }
      #usa {color: red; background-color: blue; font: 2em; font-family: arial; }
      ....
      #australia {color: yellow; background-color: white; font: 2em; font-family: arial; }
      #newzealand {color: yellow; background-color: white; font: 2em; font-family: arial; }
    </pre>
    We can see that all have the same characteristics. That is a totally fine way to control
    the appearance of the HTML page. However, we can alternatively group all HTML elements of a given continent
    in what is called a HTML class, and use CSS to tell the browser to apply some isntructions to all elements
    that belong to a given class. We use the attribute <p>class</p> in the opening tag of 
    an HTML element to identify it as belonging to a class. In our example, we could create five classes, one
    per continent, and apply them to each paragraph in the folowing way: 
    <pre>
     &lt;p id="spain" class="europe">Spain is square.&lt;/p&gt;
     &lt;p id="portugal" class="europe">Portugal is rectangular.&lt;/p&gt;
     ...
     &lt;p id="japan" class="asia">Japan is long.&lt;/p&gt;
     &lt;p id="china" class="asia">China is rectangular.&lt;/p&gt;
     ...
     &lt;p id="morocco" class="africa">Morocco has the Atlas.&lt;/p&gt;
     &lt;p id="algeria" class="africa">Algeria is big.&lt;/p&gt;
     ...
     &lt;p id="canada" class="america">Canada is cold.&lt;/p&gt;
     &lt;p id="usa" class="america">USA is rectangular.&lt;/p&gt;
     ...
     &lt;p id="austalia" class="oceania">Australia is big.&lt;/p&gt;
     &lt;p id="newzealand" class="oceania">New Zealand has two islands.&lt;/p&gt;
    </pre>
 
  And then, instead of having 193 lines in our CSS file, we can have just 5, where
  each line tells CSS how to represent each element of a class. To do that, we write
  a dot followed by the class name:
    <pre>
      .europe {color: blue; background-color: white; font: 2em; font-family: arial; }
      .asia {color: red; background-color: green; font: 2em; font-family: arial; }
      .africa {color: blue; background-color: green; font: 2em; font-family: arial; }
      .america {color: red; background-color: blue; font: 2em; font-family: arial; }
      .oceania {color: yellow; background-color: white; font: 2em; font-family: arial; }
     </pre>
    </li>
</ul>
