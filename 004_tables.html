Hi Azu!

In this lesson we will learn how to create HTML tables. Tables are a popular way
to present information: they have a series of rows where each row is composed by
one or more columns of information. An HTML table is created using the tag <b>table</b>.
Tables usually have:
<ul> 
  <li>an optional caption that tells the reader what thwe table is about. It is created with the tag <b>captiom</b></li>
  <li>an optional header row where each column has a label that allows the reader to know
    what that column is about. It is created with the tag <b>thead</b></li>
  <li>a body composed by all rows of information that the table will show. It is created
    with the tag <b>tbody</b></li>
  <li>an optional footer row where each column usually summarizes the information
    of that column. It is created with the tag <b>tfoot</b></li>
  </ul>

Each row of information in the header, body, and footer is created with the tag <b>tr</b>.
Each column of information inside a row is created with either the label <b>th</b> (short for
table header, which makes the information be written in bolder font) or with the 
label <b>td</b> (short for table data, which is the normal one), as decided by the programmer
creating the HTML table.

Let's look at the following example table:
<pre>
&lt;table&gt;                                                                   
&lt;caption&gt;Population of the planets of the Solar System&lt;/caption&gt;    
&lt;thead&gt;                                                                   
        &lt;th&gt;Name of the planet&lt;/th&gt;                                 
        &lt;th&gt;Year 2021&lt;/th&gt;                                          
        &lt;th&gt;Year 2022&lt;/th&gt;                                          
        &lt;th&gt;The future&lt;/th&gt;                                         
&lt;/thead&gt;                                                                  
&lt;tbody&gt;                                                                   
        &lt;tr&gt;                                                              
                &lt;td&gt;Mercury&lt;/td&gt;                                    
                &lt;td&gt;20&lt;/td&gt;                                         
                &lt;td&gt;21&lt;/td&gt;                                         
                &lt;td&gt;22&lt;/td&gt;                                         
        &lt;/tr&gt;                                                             
        &lt;tr&gt;                                                              
                &lt;td&gt;Venus&lt;/td&gt;                                      
                &lt;td&gt;50&lt;/td&gt;                                         
                &lt;td&gt;Muchos&lt;/td&gt;                                     
                &lt;td&gt;Pocos&lt;/td&gt;                                      
        &lt;/tr&gt;                                                             
        &lt;tr&gt;                                                              
                &lt;td&gt;Earth&lt;/td&gt;                                      
                &lt;td&gt;30&lt;/td&gt;                                         
                &lt;td&gt;9 billion&lt;/td&gt;                                  
                &lt;td&gt;Only fish&lt;/td&gt;                                  
        &lt;/tr&gt;                                                             
&lt;/tbody&gt;                                                                  
&lt;tfoot&gt;                                                                   
        &lt;tr&gt;                                                              
                &lt;th&gt;Total:&lt;/th&gt;                                     
                &lt;th&gt;80&lt;/th&gt;                                         
                &lt;th&gt;A lot&lt;/th&gt;                                      
                &lt;th&gt;A little&lt;/th&gt;                                   
        &lt;/tr&gt;                                                             
&lt;/tfoot&gt;

EXERCISES:

<ol>
  <li>Read the above HTML code and try to figure out how it should be represented in the browser.</li>
  <li>Write the above HTML code in a file, and open it with the browser. Observe how the fields are displayed.
  The columns are probably too tightly spaced, and the separation of the caption with respect to the table is
  probably too short; no lines are usually present sepeating the header from the data rows, and from the footer.
  All these presentation elements (lines, separations) will be controlled using the CSS language, which we will
  see in another lesson.</li>
  <li>Write a sample HTML page with a table that lists, for every UE country, its name, its capital, its population, 
    and a popular dish.</li>
  </ol>
