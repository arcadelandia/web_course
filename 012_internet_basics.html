    The Internet is formed by a large group of computers that are able to exchange information, and by the communication links among them.
    The number of computers in the Internet is constantly changing as some computers are connected and disconnected to/from the Internet.
    The links among those computers are typically wireless, or optical fibers.

    Strictly speaking, the computers that form part of the Internet are those that are assigned what is called a public IP address. As these are
    expensive and scarce, usually only a few entities buy them: these entities are Internet Service Providers (ISPs, businesses that allow people
      to connect to the Internet), large government organizations, and large companies. The seller of the IP addresses is an US entity named IANA, which
      works through delegation to other entities (RIPE for Europe and Middle East, ARIN for North America, AFRINIC for Africa, LAPNIC for Latin Anerica, APNIC for
      Asia Pacific). Once an entity buys a public IP address, it typically 
      configures it inside a given computer; that computer can thus be considered as being part of the Internet. However, there are many other 
      computers that also want to connect, but that do not have a public IP address. In order to allow a computer that does not have a public IP address 
      to connect to the Internet, it is given what is called a private IP address, which is a piece of configuration data that allows 
      that computer to communicate to another computer that has a public IP address, and which will act in its name when using the Internet: when the
      computer with the private IP address wants to download anyhting, it asks the computer with the public IP address to do so in its behalf, and then to
      send the results.

    For example, a wireless ISP provider may have a router in a street in a city; that router has a public IP address, and thus can communicate
    with any other computer in the Internet (download websites, send emails, etc.). Several hundreds of smartphones of people living in that street
    get assigned private IP addresses by that street router, and thus each smartphone can only communicate with the street router rather than
      with other computers in the Internet; then, whenever a smartphone downloads a website, the smartphone is asking the wireless router 
      to download it in their name, which it does, while forwarding the data to the smartphone.

      IP addresses come typically in two types: version 4 and version 6. Version 4 are typically written in a format that is four numbers separated
      by dots, like 123.20.199.200 or something like that (each number goes between 0 and 255); if the first number is a 10, or if the first numbers are
      192.168, or if the first number is a 172 and the second is between 16 and 31, then it is a private IP address; in other case, and except for a few
      cases, it will be a public IP address. IP version 6 has longer formats than version 4.

      When a computer dowenloads a website, it is sending data to the webserver indicating that it wants to download the requestes page, and the
      sebserver sends data back with whatever are the results of the request. In the same way, in a videoconference, a computer is constantly sending
      data with audio and video information, and also receiving it from the other end. In the same way as with the postal system, when the data to be
      sent is too large, it will be divided in multiple data units called packets. Each packet has the source and destination IP addresses, apart from
      the appropriate information in that packet. For example, if a webpage that we download has to be sent in 10 packets, each packet will have
      a different part of the webpage; all packets will have the IP addresses of the sender and the receiver.

      Remembering IP addresses is hard for humans, so a system called DNS appeared.
    </p>
    <p>
      traceroute shows IP addresses.
    </p>
    <p>
      whois shows the AS a IP belongs to, and contact info  about that AS; this can be used for attemps at geolocation.
    </p>
    <p>
      RIPE has online access to geolocation databases, and to route information from several points in the Internet.
