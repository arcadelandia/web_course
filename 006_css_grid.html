Hi Azu!

In this lesson we will learn how to position elements in a webpage using CSS.
Positioning is used to create header bars (the content that appears in many websites
in the upper part, which usually has logos, menus and headers), footer bars (like
header bars but at the bottom of the webpage, with terms and contitions notices, contact
information, etc), sidebars (idem but at one side of the main content of a webpage, 
either left, right, or both sides, and that usuallu contain menus).

CSS allows many alternative ways to position these elements, and we will learn one
called <b>CSS grids</b>.

There are several ways to use a CSS grid. One is as follows:
1) have a clear idea of how we want our webpage to look. Pen and paper is helpful, making
a grid diagram showing the design of the page, and what menus and images and headers are in which area.
Iterate design in the paper until you are happy with it.
2) use CSS to tell the browser that we want to use a grid design,
3) use CSS to tell the browser the design that we created on paper
4) this is optional: use CSS to tell the browser to use the full space of the window to paint
the elements, just in case there is not enough information to fll it. This is because many people
consider estethically pleasing to have something non-blank at the
bottom of the visible area of the browser (something like a footer bar or anything
like that). This tells the browser to stretch information as much as possible in order to try to
fill space until the bottom.
5) in the HTML, create a div element for each grid area; give that div a unique id.
6) use CSS to tell in which area each id will be located.
7) use CSS to create horzontal menus by taking away the vertical alignment, and the item marker,
and giving a different cursor and color of the font and/or backgrounf of an item when hovering
the mouse over it.
8) for text elements, it is typical to control color, background color, font size, and centering.
9) for image elements, it is typical to control sizes, centering, and borders.
