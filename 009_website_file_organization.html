The smallest website that we can create is composed of a single HTML file. This 
could be the case of a website that only has text, and no images, 
no videos, no CSS files, nor Javascript files. In this case, the website programmer
decides to put all its textual content in a single HTML file, no additional
content of any kind, and that's it.
</p>
<p>
However, in general, a website will have many files. One of these will
be the main HTML file of the website (the one that users will initially
open with their brower in order to access the website); in addition, there may
be more HTML files. For example, a website about the countries of Europe
may have a main HTML file and an additional HTML file for each country.
In addition, each page may have images and/or videos and/or audio files. And, in addition,
the website may have a style described in one or more CSS files. In addition,
the website may also have some kind of dynamic effect described in
one or more Javascript files.
</p>
<p>
When programmers create websites, they usually try to create a folder
structure that neatly organizes all those files needed for a website. Although one
option is to put all files in the same folder, this option
is typically frowned upon because many programmers consider that it does
not lead to a neat folder structure (hard to visualize in a file explorer). 
As a result, some folders will be created in the main website folder in order
to contain most of the files.
</p>
<p>
Several conventions are common in order to organize the files of a website.
Let's describe them:
</p>
    <ol>
<li>
Filenames and folder names are usually lowercase; this applies to all parts 
of the filemane (including the extension, if any is present). For example, 
hello.html instead of HELLO.HTML or of Hello.html.
</li>
<li>
Filenames usually only contain English alphabet characters (so no tildes or
accents, etc). For example, espana.html instead of espa√±a.html.
</li>
<li>
The main HTML file of a website is called <em>index.html</em>, and is put at the
top of the folder structure created for the website.
</li>
<li>
The names of the folders should be given according to a logical pattern as chosen
by the programmer; for example, a common one is to name folders according to the kind
of the files that are in that folder: in this way, the HTML files may go in a 
folder named <em>html</em>, the images and videos and sound files may go 
in a folder named <em>multimedia</em>, the CSS files in a folder named <em>style</em>,
and the Javascript files in a folder named <em>js</em>; sometimes, some files
  go in a folder named <em>misc</em> (short for miscellaneous) when the programmer
  is feeling too lazy to think about an adequate name for the folder. 
  <br>
  The programmer has total liberty
to choose these names, and to decide which files go where. The programmer
also, if she prefers, can create subfolders inside any folder if she thinks
that leads to an easier and neater folder structure: for example, if a website
about countries of Europe has a multimedia folder where images and videos are
put, but there are too many according to the tastes of the programmer (for example,
because they are hard to visualize in a explorer window or anything else), 
the programmer may create additional folders inside the multimedia folder
  just to not have too many files inside that folder. For example, the
  programmer can create, inside the multimedia folder, one folder per 
  country: in this way, there would be a multimedia/spain folder where
images for Spain would go, another folder named multimedia/france with
files for France, etc.
</li>
    </ol>
<p>
To sum up, a reasonable file and folder structure for any website is to
assign the name <em>index.html</em> to the file that will be the entry point 
to the website; and then to have several folders: one named <em>style</em>
containing CSS files, one named <em>js</em> containing Javascript 
files, and one named <em>multimedia</em> containing images, audio and video files.
Any additional ones will get similar suitable names.
</p>
<p>
When writing any HTML files, we will reference in various points the 
HTML, CSS, and Javascript files that also form part of the website, and
which are located in the folders and subfolders that we have created.
The HTML files will be referenced from the href attribute of the
a element; the CSS files will be referenced from the href attribute
of the link element, and the Javascript files will be referenced
from the src attribute of the script element. In addition, images
and video (and audio) files are referenced from the src property of
the img and source elements, respectively.
</p>
<p>
When writing a given HTML file that contains references to any 
other file inside our folder strucxture, we need to indicate
the path that the browser needs to follow, from the folder where
the HTML file being written is, to the folder where the desired
file is.
</p>
<p>
For example, imagine that we are writing a file named <em>index.html</em>
that will be the main entry point to a website about Europe. Besides
<em>index.html</em>, we have also created a folder named <em>html</em> to contain one HTML
file for each country (spain,html, portugal.html, france.html, etc.), and 
another folder named <em>multimedia</em> to contain
an image file for each country in Europe (spain.png, portugal.png,
france.png, etc.) 
</p>
<p>
If we want to show the image named spain.png (that is inside the
  <em>multimedia</em> folder) from the file <em>index.html</em> (that is NOT
  inside the <em>multimedia</em> folder),
we should not write
</p>
<pre>
&lt;img href="spain.png"&gt;
</pre>
<p>
because the browser will
try to find the image <em>spain.png</em> inside the folder where <em>index.html</em> is; however,
the image is not there (it is inside the <em>multimedia</em> folder instead)
so the browser will fail to find then image, and the image will not be shown to the user.
Instead, we need to write
</p>
<pre>
&lt;img href="multimedia/spain.png"&gt;
</pre>
<p>
in order to indicate that the image is inside a folder named multimedia.
</p>
<p>
When writing the file named <em>france.html</em> in the folder named <em>html</em>, 
if we want to show the image called <em>france.png</em> (which is located
in the <em>multimedia</em> folder) , we should not write
</p>
<pre>
&lt;img href="multimedia/france.png"&gt;
</pre>
<p>
because the browser will try to locate the image inside a folder named <em>multimedia</em>
inside the <em>html</em> folder (becasue that is the folder where the HTML file being written is);
however, there is no folder named <em>multimedia</em> inside the folder named
<em>html</em>; instead, the folder <em>multimedia</em> is inside the parent folder of
the <em>html</em> folder; thus, in order to fidn the image, the browser needs to go up one level
in the folder hierarchy, from there go to the multimedia folder, and grab the image from there
That is written as
</p>
<pre>
&lt;img href="../multimedia/spain.png"&gt;
</pre>
<p>
The two dots mean to go up one level, and can be used as many times
as needed. 
</p>
<p>
Idem for the CSS and Javascript files: for example, if there is a CSS file
named <em>colors.css</em> inside the <em>style</em> folder, and the <em>index.html</em>
file wants to include it, the programmer will type the following
in the <em>index.html</em> file:
</p>
<p>
&lt;link rel="stylesheet" href="style/colors.css"&gt;
</p>
<p>
Conversely, to include that same CSS file but this time from inside the <em>spain.html</em> 
  file (which is inside the <em>html</em> folder) we would write
</p>
<p>
&lt;link rel="stylesheet" href="../style/colors.css"&gt;
</p>
  <p>
  in order to indicate that the browser needs to go up one level from the folder ccontaining
  the file being written (i.e., the two dots), and from there to go to the <em>style</em> folder, 
  and there to grab the file.
  </p>
  <h1>EXERCISES</h1>
  <p>
    Create a website about the provinces of Galicia:
    <ul>
    <li>
    Create a file named <em>index.html</em> that will be the main page of the website, 
      with textual content about what the website is about, and links to the HTML files 
      for each province. 
    </li>
    <li> 
      Put the HTML pages of each province in a folder named <em>html</em>. Give lowercase
      names without non-English characters to each HTML file (as well as to any otehr kind of
      file you use in the creation of the website, either created by you or not).
    </li>
    <li>
      Find photos in the Internet about each province, and put them in a folder 
      named <em>multimedia</em>, and show the relevant photos in each HTML file 
      via <em>img</em> elements.
    </li>
    <li>
      Decide which CSS style you like for the entire website, and put it in a css file 
      inside a folder named <em>style</em>, and link to that css file from inside each and every 
      HTML file (i.e., the main <em>index.html</em>  one, and the individual ones for each province).
    </li>
    </ul>
    Have fun!!
