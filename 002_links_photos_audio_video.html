Hi Azu! In this lesson we will learn how to insert links, photos, audio, and video, in a webpage.

Links are pieces of a webpage that point to a different webpage. In order to use them, you 
typically click with the mouse on them. For example, when you make a Google search, each 
of the results is a link because, when you click on them, they lead you to another page.
In HTML jargon, they refer to another webpage. Links are usually strings of text or photos.

To create a link, we use the HTML tag <b>a</b> (whcih means address). We also need to indicate 
where it leads to: that will be the address that appears in the browser's address bar
when we open it. That address is sometimes called URL in web parlance. Inside the HTML code, 
it is indicated using the HTML word <em>href</em> (short for hypertext reference).
For example, if we want to write "The Wikipedia website is a very useful place" inside a webpage, and we want to
take the browser to the main page of Wikipedia when the user clicks on top of the "Wikipedia website" words,
we would write:

The <a href="https://www.wikipedia.org"> Wikipedia website </a> is a very useful place. 

In summary, when you want to create a HTML link, you need to go to the webpage yo uwant to link to, 
observe what appears in the browser address bar, copy it and put it into the href property inside the opening <b>a</b> tag.

If you want to link to a webpage that is stored in the same folder, you just put its name in the
href field. For example, if you create a webpage called countries.html and another
called cities.html and put them both in the same folder, and you want to link from countries.html to cities.html, 
you would do:

If you <a href="cities.html"> click here </a> you will go to see a list of cities.

Photos can included in a webpage using the HTML tag <b>img</b>. You need to indicate their name
with the <b>src</b> property. For example, if the photo is named "bird.jpg" and it is in the same
folder as your webpage, you write:
<img src="bird.jpg">
Sometimes, it is desirable to add some text that appears when the mouse is over the image; that text
is used by readers for visually impaired users. To do that, we use the HTML property <b>alt</b> (which
means alternative description).
<img src="bird.jpg" alt="This is a photo of a gaviota flying over Arcade or Paredes">

Photos can be used as links too, so when you click on them, they lead you to another page. For example,
to use the photo of the bird to lead you to the Wikipedia page for birds, you can put the <b>img</b> tag
inside the <b>a</b>:

<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird"> 
  <img src="bird.jpg"> 
</a>

Observe that in the previous example I used three lines with indentation in order to make it easier to read,
but it can be written in the same line, as HTML does not care about number of lines nor blank spaces.

The image formats more common in the web, are JPG, PNG, and SVG.

Examples can be downloaded in https://samplelib.com/

If we have a video file named "example.mp4" in the same folder as our webpage we can include it with
the <b>video</b> HTML tag doing as follows:

<video controls> <source src="example.mp4"> </video>

If we have an audio file named "example.mp3" in the same folder as our webpage, we can include it
with the <b>audio</b> HTML tag doing as follows:

<audio controls> <source src="example.mp3"> </audio>

There are many formats for audio and video files supported by browsers, but mp3 for audio and
mp4 or webm for video are usually among the simplest to find support for.

In order to find sample image, audio and video files, Google Images is a good resource, especially
with the option to look for content with Creative Commons licenses; the website https://samplelib.com/
is also a goodf resource to find sample content to use when doing HTML programming exercises.


EXERCISES:

1) Create two webpages and put them in the same folder. Name one "first.html" and the other "second.html"
2) Put a title, some text paragraphs, a photo, a video file, and an audio file in each one.
3) Put a text link in the first.html file that leads to the website of CNN; use the text "Click here to go to CNN"
To know the link address, just search for it in Google, open it, and copy what appears in the address bar (in the
case of CNN, it will probably be https://edition.cnn.com/ or something like that)
4) Put a text link in the second.html file that leads to the website of BBC; use the text "Click here to go to BBC"
5) Put a text link in the first.html file that leads to second.html; use the text "Click here to go to second"
6) Put a text link in the second.html file that leads to first.html; use the text "Click here to go to first"
7) Put an image link in the first.html file that leads to the website of RTVE; use the alt text "RTVE"
8) Put an image link in the second.html file that leads to the website of RTVG; use the alt text "RTVG"
