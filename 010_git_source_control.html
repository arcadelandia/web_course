    Programming involves creating text files; these text files are typically
    too long or complex to be created in a single programming session (e.g.,
    a couple of hours). For example, a given website could contain 10 HTML 
    files, plus 2 CSS files, and 1 Js file, and it is usually unrealistic 
    to type them all in the same sitting session.
    
    Even if a given programming task (like creating a small website) was 
    small enough to create it in a single sitting, the programmer typically
    does not like the first version that she has created, so it usually creates
    a second version containing modifications, or additions, or deletions,
    of elements of the first version; and this process is repeated several
    times until the programmer likes the final result. For example, the first
    version of a website about Europe may be just a couple of HTMLs containing
    the work of the programmer in his first two hours of work before she goes
    for lunch, then the second version adds more information to those HTML
    files and contains, then the third adds some CSS files and the elements
    inside the HTML files needed to point to the CSS files, and then the
    fourth is the version existing when the programmer stops work for
    the day, then the fifth eliminates some information that now the programmer
    thinks is excessive, and then the sixth version eliminates typos, 
    then the seventh version adds a menu in some place, etc. 
    
    When a programming project has several versions like in the previous
    example, is is oftem useful to have an easy way to refer to previous
    versions of the project: for example, it is common to work on a given
    version during several days and then, due to a redesign, try to eliminate
    whatever was done in the last versions in order to go back to a
    previous one, and continue programming from there.

    It is also frequent to want to check a version that is several times previous
    to the current one, try some changes on top of that old one, and, if they
    are not satisfactory, discard them, and go back to the original, more advanced
    version.

    In theory, if the programmer is well organized in her job, she can zip
    all files of the project whenever she wants to create a version, and store
    the zip file in a separate folder giving it a descriptive name; then, whenever she wants to recover
    a previous version, she just grabs the corresponding zip file, unzips its
    contents in the main project folder, and work from there. And, if she
    ends up not being happy with whatever she does on top of that version,
    she can simply erase them, go back to the folder of zip files and then
    recover the zip file of the version she was working with, and continue from there.
    Each zip file acts as a snapshot of the project at a specific point in time.
    
    However, although using sepearate zip files is an acceptable option,
    the task of managing several versions of a project, being able to know
    how many versions we produced, and to know how they differ (i.e., which
    files they have, and which content are in those files, and the differences
    between any tow versions) is so common, that programmers have created tools
    specifically in charge of managing versions of groups of files used in programming projects.
    These are called <b>version control</b> systems. Sometimes they are also called
    source control because one of their main uses is to control versions 
    of source code (source code being what programmers type), apart from
    other types of files like photos, audio files, video files, etc.

    There are many source cotrol systems; the most popular nowadays is called
    <b>git</b>, and it is the one you are most likely to work with if you have
    a programming job. In this lession, we will learn the basics of git.

    If you are using Windows, go to google and type <b>git for windows</b>,
    and one of the first links will lead you to the website <b>https://git-scm.com</b>.
    Go there, download git, and install it; during installation you will be
    asked several questions; usually, there is a default answer that you will
    not need to change; however, the one that you should change is the one
    that will ask you <b>Which editor would you like Git to use?</b> or something
    like that: in this case, there is a default option that probably says 
    something like <b>Vim</b> (Vim is a text editor simpler than Notepad++ but a little
    more complex to use); in order to make your life easier, you shoulkd 
    choose instead Notepad++ if available, or Notepad; if no option other than
    the default one is available, leave it as it is (thid option selects
    the text editor that will, once you want to create a version of yourt
    project, let you write a description of what that version exacly contains,
    and this is handy because programmers tend to easily forget details
    about their programs, so git allows you to write any description you
    want when creating a version).

    There are many videos and webpoages about git in general, and installing
    git in windows in particular. Feel free to check any if you have any doubt.

    To check that git has been correctly installed, open a new command prompt (do not
    use one that was open before installing git, if you had any open); you open a command prompt by typing 
    Windows + R, and then typing <b>cmd</b> and then pressing Enter. Inside the command
    prompt, type <b><git --version</b>. If git isntalled correctly, you
    should see a message that says the version of git that you have installed.
    If, instead, you see an error saying that git has not been found, there
    was some installation error, and you will need to troubleshoot.
    
    <h1>Using git in your computer to manage a project from scratch</h1>
   <ul>
     <li>Create a folder named exercise1 in your Desktop. This will be the root folder of your example project for
     this lesson.</li>
     <li>Open the command prompt and change to that folder. (Alt+X, cmd, enter, and then cd Desktop/exercise1)</li>
     <li>In order to create a project from scratch that uses git, you type <em>git init</em>. A folder named
     <b>.git</b> will be created, possibly after asking you for your name and email (you do not need to put
     anything real in those fields if you do not want; they will be shown to anybody you share your project
     with later). You will not need to go inside that folder for any reason (but you can if you want, to take
     a look at what is there), but it stores all information that git needs to do its job, so make sure that
     you do not accidentally delete it (in the next lession we will see how to make backups of this .git folder
     by means of online git managers such as the one in github.com, or the one in gitlab.com).</li>
     <li>Create a file named index.html and write anything inside (for example, a couple of tags), and save the content.</li>
     <li>Type in the command prompt, git status. This command shows a summary of what is going on
     with the files in  your project. Initially, it will tell you that the file index.html is not being tracked, or something like
     that. This means that git does not have any idea of whether it should manage that file (store any change you
     may do in the future just in case you want to see it in a previous version later). To tell git to manage
     that file, you type git add index.html. This adds the current state of the file to an area called the stage, contained
     inside the .git folder (you do not need to worry about what happens inside the .git )</li>
     <li>type git status again. It will tell you that it is tracking the file.</li>
     <li>create, inside the exercise1 foldcer, another folder named blablabla, and inside it create a file named example.html.Write 
     any information inside it (e.g., the doctype tag), and save it.</li>.
     <li>from the command promt, and being in the Desktop/exercise1 folder, type git add blablabla/example.html</li>
     <li>type git status again. It will tell you that it is tracking the example.html file.</li>
     <li>If you want to create a snapshot of the work you just did in both files, you use the command git commit.
       This takes whatever is in the stage area (where you put the files before via the git add command) and
       writes it to its own records (stored inside the .git folder too) jointlyt with a textual explanation
       written by you, which will be shown in the future to anybody that uses git to look at your project (which
       is typically just you, or any collaborator that you may give your .git folder to). When you type git commit,
     git will ask you to write a small text line with a brief descrioption of what you did (it is uisually
       written starting with a verb in lowercase, directed to a hypothetical person doing the job of git, like*
       create a firtst version of the webpage, or, create a skeleton of the webpage, or anything like
       that, but can be whatever you want). In addition, a longer description can be also added, with
     as many lines as you want, by leaving the second line as blank, and starting to write in the
     third line. For example, it could be something like this.</li>
     <pre>
       add a first version of the webpage

       I put only a skeleton index.html, plus a small exercise.html
       inside a folder named blablabla because I did not have time
       to put more information. When I return from lunch break, I will
       write more stuff, and perhaps add more files.
     </pre>
     <li>Type git log. It will show you the version you have just created</li>
     <li>Add more information to the index.html file, and save it</li>
     <li>Also add more information to the exercise.html file, and save it</li>
     <li>Type git diff. It will show you a series of differences with the previouslyu stored version of the project. This allows
     you to quickly see what did you do since last version.</li>
     <li>If you are happy with your work, and want to store it, do git status to have a list of all changed files, and
     then do git add <filename> for all files that changed. Then, do git commit, and write a descriptive message.</li>
     <li>Type git log, and observe your two versions (each version is called a commit in git parlance, so you will see
     two commits; each commit has associated your descriptive message, and a unique id that looks like a string of 
     letters and numbers (it is what is called a hexadecimal identifier).</li>
     <li>Whenever you create a new file to add to your project, you add it via git add <file>, where file will
     be prepended by the path to its containinmg folder if it is not in the root folder of the project.</file>
    <li>If you want to remove a file, you type git rm <filename></li>
    <li>After doing this during the development of any project, you will have many versions of your project, whose descriptions
      can be checked by using git log. If you want to see the differences between the current version of your project and
    an old one, you type git diff <hexadecimal ID of the version you want to compare to></li>
     <li>If for any reason you lose the files of your project but you have the .git folder, you just need to copy that
     folder somewhere, let`s say recoverfolder, and then go to recoverfolder and type <b>git reset --hard</b>. Youy
     will recover the last version of the project, and continue working as usual like nothing happened.</li>
     <li>Sometimes, git will complain about doing not being able to do something; usually that means that you ahve
     not yet saved all files you are working with (in the text editor) or that the file that you have added to
     the stage (for purposes of rpeparing it to be commited to the git history) has changed too. If that happens,
     do not forget to save all your files, and then to do git add <file> for each file that yo uhave saved from
     the text editor.</li>
     <li>THere are many online tutorials about using git to manage programming projects, both in general, and
     in Windows. Take a look at some targeted at beginners, in order to get a feeling for what people do with git.</li>
