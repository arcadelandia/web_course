HTML (acronym of hypertext markup language) is a way to tell a web browser 
two things: 1) what information we want to show in
a webpage, and 2) how to represent that information. This includes the text of the
page, plus any links to other pages that we want to inttoduce, plus
images, plus videos, plus buttons, plus forms to allow the viewers of the webpage
to input information, etc. These elements are collectively called hypertext. 

HTML does not care about the amount of whitespace between words or about how many
lines we have in a document. If we write a file with very long lines,
and another with the same content but with very short lines, and another with several whitespaces between
words, and another with just one whitespace between words, and finally we open them with
a web browser, the four files will be represented in the screen as exactly
equal to each other. If we want to control the presentation of the text (line length, separation between
lines, centering of headings, etc), we will need to use another language called CSS (we will learn it in a later lesson).

HTML is what is called a markup language, because it uses special words or
sequences of characters (called markup in the world of text edition) to instruct 
the browser about how it should present the webpage to the viewer.
Each markup language uses its special words. HTML does too; for example, the 
markup word "b" (without quotes) means to bring the attention of the webpage reader 
to the text that follows (browsers usually interpret that by writing the text in bold); 
in a related example, the markup word "/b" (without quotes) means to stop bringing the 
attention of the reader to that part of the text (so, if the
browser was writing text in bold until that moment, it stops doing so). In HTML, the
"b" is called an opening markup word, and the "/b" is called a closing markup word.

In HTML, to tell the browser that we want to use a markup word, we enclose the word
inside the "less than" and "more than" symbols. For example, to use the markup
word "b", we would write it as: "<b>" (without the quotes). This is needed because otherwise it would be
impossible to write the letter "b" as a separate word by itself in a document, as the browser
would interpret it as a command rather than a a word to be shown on the screen. For example, if we want
to write the list of four seasons, with the middle two written
in bold font, we would create an HTML document with 
the content: "spring <b> summer autumn </b> winter". The browser will write in the screen
the names of the four seasons, bolding the two middle words, and nothing else: 
it will not show in the screen neither "<b>" nor "</b>".

In another example, the markup word "em" means to emphasize the content that follows (browsers
usually do this by using italics); the markup word "/em" means to stop emphasizing the 
text. Markup words can be combined; for example, if we want to write a phrase
in bold and italics at the same time, we would use the "b" "em" markup words together (in any order
we want), write the text that we want to write, and then use "/b" "/em" to tell the
browser to stop. When using several markup words together, it is usually recommended to
write the closing markup words in reverse order to the opening one. For example, both the phrase
"spring <em> <b> summer autumn </em> </b> winter" and the phrase
"spring <em> <b> summer autumn </b> </em> winter" are correct, but the second is usually preferred
when creating HTML because the closing tags are in reverse order to the opening ones (this is, we
opened first with "em" and second with "b", and closed first with "b" and second with "em").

An HTML document is usually saved in a plain-text file whose name ends 
with either ".html" or ".htm", although ".html" is preferred. If we write any
other extension at the end, and we open that file with the web browser, the web browser will 
not interpret its contents as markup language, and will show instead the plain-text of the
page. For example, if we write "One <b> two </b>" in a file called "example.html" and open
it in a web browser, the web browser will show the word "two" in bold; however, if we 
call the file "example.txt" and open it with the browser, the browser will not pay attention
to the markup words, and instead it will show everything in the screen, both markup words
and normal words.
  
HTML calls "elements" to its markup words. Some of the most common HTML elements are:
"title": tells the browser which title to show on the tab where the webpage is opened (above the page itself, usually)
"p": tells the browser that we want to open a paragraph (the browser will usually put more vertical whitespace than inside a praragraph)
"h1": creates a big heading
"h2": creates a slightly smaller heading than h1
"h3": creates a slightly smaller heading than h2
"h4": creates a slightly smaller heading than h3
"br": forces a line break (usually to write poetry, or anything 
  that requires a line break at a given point). It does not have a closing element, as it does not make sense.
"b": brings attention to the text starting at that point (usually means bold, unless in reading devices for the blind, etc)
"em": emphasizes the text starting at that point(usually means italics)
"u": underlines
"ol": creates a bulleted ordered list (where each item as a number or letter)
"ul": creates a bulleted unordered list (where each item has an asterisk or a dot)
"item": inside a bulleted list, creates a new item.  

Most markup words need opening and closing version (e.g., "b" and "/b", "p" and "/p", or "h1" and "/h1"), 
because we need to tell the browser when to start and end doing what we want it to do. 
(for example, when bolding text, we need to tell when to start, and when to stop).
However, some markup words do not need a closing version because it does not make
sense: for example, "br" inserts a new line, so it appears by itself whenever when we want
to insert one.

  
For example, let's assume that we write the following:
=====================================================
<h1>Provinces of Galicia</h1>
<p>Galicia has four provinces</p>
<>
  
  
===================================================
