  <h1>Downloading data from the web using Javascript</h1>
<p>
Websites basically present data to their users. Most of the websites we interact with, have data 
geared towards a human user: HTML to say what to present, and CSS to say how to present it.
</p>
<p>
However, there are also websites that intend to make their data easy to access, not specifically to humans, but to
computers. The main difference between humans and computers is that computers are not as good
as humans to search for a given piece of information if it is in the middle of more data that
does not have a clear structure. For example, it is reasonably easy for a human to look at a generic 
photo and try to see if there is
something in that photo (for example, a fruit on top of a book); a computer has a much harder
time doing that. Computers are better at processing information that has been structured in some
way, usually by adding special labels inside the information itself (for example, following the previous
example, the photo file could contain a list of objects that appear in the photo, plus their coordinates
inside the photo, as if the photo was a map; that list of objects could have been prepared by a human). 
 In essence, when website data is targeted towards being used by a computer,
or being used by a program running in a computer, its data tends to be made available in a file format that
makes it easy for the computer to make sense of it. There are many file formats to do this; a popular
one in web programming is called the JSON file format.
</p>
<p>
JSON is short for Javascript Object Notation, and it was designed to make it easy for Javascript
programs to deal with website data. For example, this is a JSON file that could be used to describe
the contents of a photo:
 <pre>
 [ 
   {"cosa": "manzana", "donde": "102px,20px", "color": "rojo"}, 
   {"cosa": "libro", "donde": "700px,500px", "tapadura": "parece serlo"}, 
   {"cosa": "gato", "donde": "200px,40px", "pelo": "gris con rayas"}
 ]
 </pre>
 The same contents could be describned with an HTML file like this one:
 <pre>
  &lt;p&gt;
   Hay un gato de pelo gris con rayas hacia la mitad de la foto, centrado en las 
   coordenadas 200,400 medida en pixels desde
   la esquina inferior izquierda. Hay una manzana roja en 102,20, y un libro que parece
   de tapa dura en las coordenadas 700,500.
  &lt;/p&gt;
 </pre>
 The previous HTML file is perhaps easier to read for a human rather than the JSON file. THe JSON file, however,
 has a very specific format, clearly delineating each element, and each attribure of each element, so it is
  used more often than HTML. However, another HTML file like the following could also be used to clearly
  convey the same information:
  <pre>
   &lt;table&gt;
     &lt;thead&gt;
      &lt;tr&gt;
        &lt;th&gt;Nombre&lt;/th&gt;
        &lt;th&gt;Coordenadas&lt;/th&gt;
        &lt;th&gt;Descripcion&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;/tr&gt;
     &lt;/thead&gt;
     &lt;tbody&gt;
      &lt;tr&gt;
       &lt;td&gt;Manzana&lt;/td&gt;
       &lt;td&gt;102px,20px&lt;/td&gt;
       &lt;td&gt;Color rojo&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;/tr&gt;
      &lt;tr&gt;
       &lt;td&gt;Libro&lt;/td&gt;
       &lt;td&gt;700px,500px&lt;/td&gt;
       &lt;td&gt;Parece de tapa dura&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;/tr&gt;
      &lt;tr&gt;
       &lt;td&gt;Gato&lt;/td&gt;
       &lt;td&gt;200px,40px&lt;/td&gt;
       &lt;td&gt;Gris con rayas&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;/tr&gt;
     &lt;/tbody&gt;
   &lt;/table&gt;
  </pre>
In theory, a Javascript program could download whatever data it needs
in HTML format, but HTML is a format designed mainly for human consumption; JSON attempts to be easier
to handle by programs because it forces the existence of semantic labels (those semantic labels would
 be the words <em>cosa, donde, color, pelo, tapadura</em>). 
whereas the HTML format does not force the existence of those labels, as we saw in the first HTML file 
above, which uses a paragraph to use Spanish to describe the photo, and it would be hard for a program
  to extract the number of objects and their characteristics from the analysis of the Spanish text. 
  The second HTML file, in contrast, already has those labels, and it wouild be as easy to process
  for a computer as the JSON file. Anyway, JSON is more often found in the Internet than HTML
  as a file format to transfer information from a computer program to another, so we
  will focus on JSON in this lesson.
</p>
<p>
The rules to make information easy to access for a computer are usually  
called an API (short for application program interface); the ones to interact with humans are
usually called GUI (short for graphical user interface). Thus, the 
rules to access information via JSON are called a JSON API.
</p>
<p>
Most JSON files are used to represent sequences of attributes with values (foe example, weight and 40kg), 
which often represents
objects from the real world. As a result, these collections of attributes with values are called JSON objects.
A JSON attribute together with its value is also called a JSON property. For example, we can represent a given orange fruit
with a JSON object, with an attribute called <b>weight</b> whose value is <b>100g</b>, and an attribute 
called <b>color</b> which can be <b>orange</b>, an attribute called <b>bittenByABug</b> whose
value may be <b>some people say yes, some people say no</b>, and an attribute called
<b>numberOfBugsLivingInside</b> whose value is <b>35</b>. We are free to put any number of
attributes in an object, and to give any value that we wish to those attributes, and to write them
in any order we wish. The JSON way to represent this orange object would be:
<pre>
 {
   "weight": "100g",
   "color": "orange",
   "bitenByBug": "some people say yes, some people say no",
   "numberOfBugsLivingInside": 35
 }
</pre>
The presence of blank spaces is irrelevant outside of the inside of quotes (where by blank spaces we
  mean the space bar ones, and any tabs, and newlines); the spaces between quotes are relevant
  because they have meaning (for example, <b>red car</b> is different from <b>redcar</b>). For example, 
  the above example file is for practical purposes the same as the following one:
<pre>
{"weight":"100g","color":"orange","bitenByBug":"some people say yes, some people say no","numberOfBugsLivingInside":35}
</pre>
When presenting JSON files for human reading, those spaces are often used to make it prettier. When transferring them
between computers, the semantically meaningless spaces are usually eliminated.
</p>
<p>
JSON bbjects are represented betweeen brackets, with their properties separated by commas, and where
each property has an attribute name written between quotes, and an attribute value that either
is an integer name (which may be written without quotes), or a piece of information of any kind (which
must be written inside quotes), or a boolean valuie that may be <b>true</b> or <b>false</b> (without quotes),
or the value <b>null</b> (without quotes), which means that that specific property has an empty value (whatever
that means is up to interpretation according to the rules used by the website that creates the JSON object).
</p>
<p>
JSON files can also have collections of objects. These collection of objects are called arrays,
and are written between square brackets; order inside an array matters. For example, if we have a box with three objects: an apple, an strawberry,
and a beach ball, we can represent those contents as:
<pre>
[
 {"weight": "80g", "isFruit": "yes", "fruitType": "apple", "color": "green", "isItMine": "yes"},
 {"weight": "20g", "isFruit": "yes", "fruitType": "strawberry", "isItMine": "maybe", "willIEatItSoon": "hopefully so"},
 {"weight": "400g", "isFruit": "no", "description": "beach ball", "isItMine": "no", "color": "blue", "texture": "plastic"},
]
</pre>
  
Many websites offer data in JSON format. Websites like these are intended to be used by browsers running Javascript programs;
  these programs typically download the JSON data and represent it in the browser in some way that is nice for
  the users of that webiste, or of other websites. For example, let' consider
  a hypothetical news website <em>castillanews.com</em>, which offers pieces of information in JSON, which include things 
  like headines and brief descripions of news items; this means that, when connecting to <b>https://castillanews.com/</b>,
  users (both humans observing it, or web browsers downloading it with Javascript), see something like this:
  <pre>
  [
  { "headline": "New province discovered!", "description": "Earthquake creates new province near the Padornelo", "date": "01/01/2024 13:00GMT"},
  { "headline": "UFOs in Burgos", "description": "UFOs land in Burgos due to lack of fuel; they stay until Monday", "date": "01/01/2024 13:10GMT"},
  { "headline": "Sky is blue", "description": "Researchers have confirmed that the sky is blue; other opinions exist", "date": "01/01/2024 13:12GMT"}
  ]
  </pre>
  Then, the programmers creating another website, for example <em>https://universenews.com</em>, can use a Javascript program
  in their website that connects to castillanews.com each minute, downloads the JSON information like the example above, and show the
  headlines and dates in their top of the page; they may also download at the same time other JSDN files from other news websites,
  and combine all that information; the possibilities here are endless, as decided by the programmer creating the webpage.
  </p>
<p>
  In another example, imagine that the website <em>https://trackacar.com</em> offers services to track a vehicle as as function of 
  its license plate, in such a way that if a user wants to know the last coordinates of the car whose license plate is ES123456ABC,
  the need to write in the browser <em>https://trackacar.com?licenseplate=ES123456ABC</em> (so, a closing interrogation sign is
  written after the website name, and the data is written in a format like: property equals value), and the website returns a JSON object
  like this:
  <pre>
  {"position": "45.23478N, 5.234W", "dateandtime": "15/03/2023 18:23:44GMT"}
  </pre>
  which are the coordinates of the last known position of the vehicle. Then, the designer of a website called <em>https://showmyfriendscars.com</em>
  that has a list of license plates of the vehicles of its 10 best friends, can use Javascript to download periodically (e.g., each minute) the position
  of all its friends' cars, and, using a map of the world as the background photo of the website, plot a big yellow circle on each of the 
  points of the coordinates of the cars, so it creates a easy way to visually track where are those cars.
  </p>
<p>
  Many websites that offer JSON data often ask for payment, others are free; in many cases, you need to register in the website itself before
  being able to access the JSON data. A typical way to register is by entering an email and then receiving in the emnail 
  what is called an API key, which is essentially a password that allows to access the services of the website. For example, 
  imagine that the license plate tracker website asks for registration before giving the information (with or witout payment) and 
  sends to our email the API key <em>wq345rfds9dh</em> (API keys tend to look like random data, and they tend to be longer than in this example); each
  registered user will receive a different API key that will allow the website owner to keep track of how often each user
  uses the service; websites that ask for payment often charge monthly a credit card number provided by the user when regiatering the email, 
  and the amount depends on how many times the API key has been used to connect to the servide.
  The website will tell us how to use that API key to access the information. One common way is to append it to the URL that is used to
  access the browser like
  <pre>
  https://trackacar.com?licenseplate=ES123456ABC&apikey=wq345rfds9dh
  </pre>
 The above way to write needed pieces of information (in this example, license plate and api key) is called URL parameters. The name of the
  website is written normally <em>https://trackacar.com</em>, and the start of the needed parameters are indicated by the interrogation sign <b>?</b>,
  and then the parameters themselves are written separated by an ampersand <b>&</b> and each parameter is written with an equal sign <b>=</b>
  separating the name of the parameter from its value. The ownwer of the website will tell us which names we need to use , and the format
  that we need to use for its values. For example, a hypothetical website tellig us the weather forecast for a given city for a given day
  could be in any of the following formats:
  <pre>
  https://www.favoriteweatherforecaster.com?city=burgos&country=spain&date=25/12/2034
  https://www.favoriteweatherforecaster.com?city=burgos&country=spain&date=25/12/2034&apikey=213rfcvwvcewfg
  https://www.favoriteweatherforecaster.com?coordinates=42.35N3.7W&date=25/12/2034&apikey=213rfcvwvcewfg
  </pre>
  
  Sometimes, instead of URL parameters, or in addition to URL parameters, the webiste where we are
  registering will tell us that we need to use a HTTP header with some information: for example, that
  the API key needs to be sent in a HTTP request header named <b>myapikey</b>, and whose value
  must be the APIkey that we received in the email. We will see below how to do this using Javascript.
  </p>

<p>
  You can search in Google for something like "free public APIs" to find many websites that offer APIs to
  access data through the Internet (usually in JSON format), in areas like weather, transportation, literature,
  games, jobs, shopping, tracking, art, etc.
</p>
<p>  
  One of the easiest ways to grab data from a website using Javascript is by means of something called a Javascript object.
  A Javascript object is a collection of data properties, also called fields, related to something that often
  is an object from the real world. For example, a car is an object, and we can create properties in it like
  number of doors, color, maximum speed, etc. Another example of a Javascript object can be a poem, whose
 properties may be the language, its length in lines, its length in letters, its year of publication, and a series
 of reviews. Another example can be a website, whose properties can be its URL, the name of the
 person that last requested the website, and its size in bytes.
 
 A Javascript object can be created in several ways, but a common one is to declare a variable and initialize
 it with opening and closing brackets. In  other words, we create an object doing  something like
  this: <b>let micoche = {};</b>. This tells the browser that there is a variable that we chose to call
  <em>micoche</em> that will be a series of properties like we saw in the examples above. Each property has
 a name and a value, and we create those in the Javascript code; names should not contain whitespace, nor
 non-english letters. For example, we can create the examples above
 writing something like <b>micoche.marca = "Volkswagen";</b>
 <pre>
 let micoche = {};
 micoche.numerodepuertas = 5;
 michoche.color = "azul claro casi verde";
 micoche.maximumspeed = "180km/h";
 
 let mipoema = {};
 mipoema.lenguage = "castellano moderno";
 mipoema.numerodelineas = 25;
 mipoema.numerodeletras = 578;
 mipoema.anhodepublicacion = 2020;
 mipoema.criticas = [ "muy malo, no me gusta", "genial, obra maestra", "ni fu ni fa", "Pssssss. No lo tengo claro." ];
 
 let paginawebpreferida = {};
 paginawebpreferida.url = "https://www.paginawebquetengoqueinvenatarme.ejemplo.com/blablalba/blublublu.html?queso=si&nocilla=si";
 paginawebpreferida.ultimoenacceder = "jimmy jones";
 paginawebpreferida.tamanhoenbytes = 100200;
  </pre>

We can create objects ourselves, and also we can use special objects that are created by the browser.
One of these special objects, called a XMLHttpRequest, makes it easy to download data from websites, 
either with JSON content or nor. Its name comes from a kind of data named XML that we are not
going to study, and that used to be popular years ago; most data is not XML anymore (for example,
it is JSON, or HTML, or CSS, or Javascript, or images, or videos) but the name stuck; in addition, 
the word HTTP is the name of the set of rules, or protocol, that web browsers use to download 
data from any website. So, an XMLHttpRequest object is basically an object that allows us to make
a request to download any kind of data from a website. Each XMLHttpRequest object has several properties
that we do not need to care about other than make sure that are correctly setup, and we do that by
writing something like <b>let datosdemiwebpreferida = new XMLHttpRequest()\;</b>, which declares
a XMLHttpRequest object ready to be used (in other words, we do that, instead of declaring something like
<b>let datosdemiwebpreferida = {};</b> which would not create any of the needed properties). 
We can add as many additional properties to the XMLHttpRequest object as we want.
</p>
<p>
 Once we do the request, there are several possibilities: either it
 will be successful and the requested information is downloaded successfully, or the webserver will tell us that
 the information is not accessible (for any reason), or the connection attempt fails (because it takes too long,
 oir because the user decides to cancel the connection hitting the ESC key or the cross button in the menu).
 If the download is successful, the browser will call the function whose name we store in a property called
 <b>onload</b> in the XMLHttpRequest object, and will have the data available in a property called <b>response</b>,
 the XMLHttpRequest object can be accesed in that function by means of the word <b>this</b>.
 If the connection succeeds but the info is not available, the browser will call the 
 function whose name we store in the <b>onerror</b> property. If the connection succeeds but the info is not available, 
 the browser will call the function whose name we store in a property called <b>onabort</b>. 
 While the connection is still pending (this is, has started but not yet finished), the browser will call
 the function whose name we store in the <b>onmprogress</b> property. Let's see these with an example:
  </p>
<p>
Let's imagine that we want to connect to a website named <em>https://datosdemipueblofavorito.com/blablabla</em>,
 that returns a JSON file with weather data related to whatever town we indicate in the URL in two parameters that
 must be named <b>nombrepueblo</b> and <b>nombrepais</b>. So, for example, if we call
 <em>https://datosdemipueblofavorito.com/blablabla?nombrepueblo=madrid&pais=spain</em>,
 , we receive a JSON file like this one:
 <b>{"temperatura": "20C", "velocidadviento": "5km/h", "diasseguidossinllover": 5, "prevision": "marejada fuerte"}</b>.
 In order to access this website, we register in it, and the registration process sends us instructions by email
 telling us that we need an apikey to access the data, and the
 apikey value is <em>qwerty123456ZX</em>, and that we need to send that apikey inside a URL parameter named <b>apikey</b>, and that we also 
 need to include a second parameter with the name of to include a HTTP request header whose name needs to be <b>campoQueMiWebMeDiceQueTengoQuePoner</b> whose value
 needs to be <b>Loquesea</b>, and another HTTP request header whose name needs to be <b>otroCampoQueMiWebMeDiceQueTengoQuePoner</b>
 and whose value needs to be <b>OtraCosa</b>. Then, we want to log in a paragraph named <b>parrafo_de_incidencias</b> all relevant
 information related to any error and to sucess of the data download. And, if the download is successful, we want to
 show all the data received (this is, the entire JSON file) in a paragraph named <b>parrafo_de_contenido</b>, and
 the temperature and wind speed in a paragraph called <b>parrafo_de_temperatura_y_viento</b>.
 The following Javascript code does that for the town of Madrid, Spain:
  <pre>
  let cosas = new XMLHttpRequest();
  // now we prepare the request
  cosas.onload = cosas_a_hacer_tras_descargar;
  cosas.onerror = cosas_a_hacer_si_falla_la_descarga;
  cosas.onprogress = cosas_a_hacer_regularmente_mientras_descargo;
  cosas.onabort = cosas_a_hacer_si_hay_fallos_imprevistos;
  cosas.open("GET", "https://paginawebpreferida.com/blablabla?apikey=qwerty123456ZX&nombrepueblo=Madrid&nombrepais=Spain");
  cosas.setRequestHeader("campoQueMiWebMeDiceQueTengoQuePoner", "Loquesea");
  cosas.setRequestHeader("otroCampoQueMiWebMeDiceQueTengoQuePoner", "OtraCosa");
  cosas.ciudad = "Madrid"; // we create this property, in order to store the name of the city we ask for, in whatever format we prefer
  cosas.pais = "Espanha"; //  we create this property, in order to store the name of the country we ask for, in whatever format we prefer
  // the request has been prepared, so now we can send it
  cosas.send(); 
  
  function cosas_a_hacer_tras_descargar() {
   document.getElementById("parrafo_de_incidencias").innerHTML += "Descarga finalizada. En total descargamos" + this.response.length + " bytes.";
   document.getElementById("parrafo_de_contenido").innerHTML += this.response;
   let tempyviento = JSON.parse(this.response);
   document.getElementById("parrafo_de_temperatura_y_viento").innerHTML += "Datos de temperatura y viento en: " + this.ciudad + ", " + cosas.pais + ".<br>";
   document.getElementById("parrafo_de_temperatura_y_viento").innerHTML += "La temperatura es: " + tempyviento.temperatura + "<br>";
   document.getElementById("parrafo_de_temperatura_y_viento").innerHTML += "La velocidad del viento es: " + tempyviento.velocidadviento + "<br>";
  }
  function cosas_a_hacer_si_falla_la_descarga() {
   document.getElementById("parrafo_de_incidencias").innerHTML += "Descarga fallida.";
  }
  function cosas_a_hacer_regularmente_mientras_descargo() {
   document.getElementById("parrafo_de_incidencias").innerHTML += "Descarga todavia en progreso...";
  }
  function cosas_a_hacer_si_hay_fallos_imprevistos() {
   document.getElementById("parrafo_de_incidencias").innerHTML += "Hubo un error imprevisto.";
  }
  </pre>
  The order of URL parameters in the URL request does not matter (for example, here we wrote first the apikey, then
the name of town, and then the name of country; we could have written those in any order).
  When we receive a response, we can access its data is by means of <b>this.response</b>.
  The size of the response itself, in bytes, can be accessed with <b>this.response.length</b>.
  If, as in this example, we know that the response is JSON data, we can create a Javascript object that makes it easy to work with
  it by using a function called JSON.parse in the following way;<b>let tempyviento = JSON.parse(this.response);</b>. Once
that is done, we can access the value of any property in the downloaded JSON data by using a dot and the name of that property:
for example, the expression <b>tempyviento.temperatura</b> has a value of <b>20C</b>, and <b>tempyviento.temperatura</b> has
a value of <b>5km/h</b>.
  </p>

<p>
  In Javascript, We can have different downloads from the same or diferent websites at the same time. If this
 is the case, there is no way to know in advance which of those will finish earlier, or which ones
 will fail; even if we send them in a given order that we control in the Javascript code by means of the
 <b>miobject.send();</b> function, due to Internet congestion, and to the fact
  that sometimes websites process requests out of order, or to the fact that we are accessing different
  websites, or to different sizes of different downloads, those requests can finish in any order. In this case,
  when the browser calls the corresponding <b>onload,onerror,onprogress,onabort</b> functions, 
 it may be confusing to know which download is which. To help distinguishing them when they finish,
  we can either use a different function for each one or, to save typing, we can reuse the same function
  for all our dowloads; in this last case, we need a way to distinguish which of the downloads is the
  one that finished; one easy way to do this is to add a properties to each XMLHttpRequest object with 
 a unique identifier that allows us to recognize it later. E.g.,
  imagine that there is a website that allows us to get information about the weather in sone town by calling
  <b>https://mitiempometeorologifavorito.com/NAMEOFTOWN</b>, where we put the name of the town at the end. And it
  returns information in the following JSON format:
  <pre>
  {"humidity": "40%", "temperature": "28C", "riskOfFire": "medium to high"}
  </pre>
  
  Then, if we want to get the temperature from Arcade and Soutomaior and plot it in a paragraph whose id
  is <em>parrafo</em>, then we can use one of the two following styles of Javascript code. The first is this one:
  
  <pre>
  let pueblo1 = new XMLHttpRequest();
  let pueblo2 = new XMLHttpRequest();
  pueblo1.onload = cosas_a_hacer_al_recibir_datos_de_arcade;
  pueblo2.onload = cosas_a_hacer_al_recibir_datos_de_soutomaior;
  pueblo1.open("GET", "https://mitiempometeorologifavorito.com/arcade")
  pueblo2.open("GET", "https://mitiempometeorologifavorito.com/soutomaior")
  pueblo1.send()
  pueblo2.send()
  
  function cosas_a_hacer_al_recibir_datos_de_arcade() {
   let datos = JSON.parse(this.response);
   document.getElementById("parrafo").innerHTML += "Recibida info de Arcade. La temperatura es " + datos.temperature;
  }
  function cosas_a_hacer_al_recibir_datos_de_soutomaior() {
   let datos = JSON.parse(this.response);
   document.getElementById("parrafo").innerHTML += "Recibida info de Soutomaior. La temperatura es " + datos.temperature;
  }
  </pre>
  The second is this other one, where the same function is used for both downloads, and the information
  about the town is inside a field in the XMLHttpRequest object that we chose to name <b>nombreDelSitio</b>:
  
  <pre>
  let pueblo1 = new XMLHttpRequest();
  let pueblo2 = new XMLHttpRequest();
  pueblo1.nombreDelSitio = "Arcade";
  pueblo2.nombreDelSitio = "Soutomaior";
  pueblo1.onload = cosas_a_hacer_al_recibir_datos;
  pueblo2.onload = cosas_a_hacer_al_recibir_datos;
  pueblo1.open("GET", "https://mitiempometeorologifavorito.com/arcade")
  pueblo2.open("GET", "https://mitiempometeorologifavorito.com/soutomaior")
  pueblo1.send()
  pueblo2.send()
  
  function cosas_a_hacer_al_recibir_datos() {
   let datos = JSON.parse(this.response);
   document.getElementById("parrafo").innerHTML += "Recibida info de " + this.nombreDelSitio + ". La temperatura es " + datos.temperature;
  }
  </pre>
  
As we can see, in this second style, we are reusing the same onload function for both web requests. As a note, we can see
that we chose not to do anything for the onerror,onabort, and onprogress functions in order to simplifyt the example; that means
that, if any download fails, we will not react in any way (this is in general not recommended because it is often better to
tell the user if any error happened).
