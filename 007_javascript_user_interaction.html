<h1>Introduction to Javascript</h1>
<p>
Once a webpage has been created using HTML and CSS, its appearance in
the screen will usually not change: the text in is text elements (paragraphs,
  headers, lists) will remain as is; the color of the text and backgrounds 
  will too; same for images, video, forms, tables; the CSS grid that
  we designed to put the elements in, will remain unaltered as well. 
</p>
<p>
In some situations, modifying the content of the webpage is desirable: 
for example, we may want to connect periodically to some other
Internet webpage (e.g., our favorite news site), and grab some information
from it (e.g., the breaking news headlines) and print that information in some area of
our webpage. Or, we may want to allow the user to interact with the webpage in some
way: for example, using a button to allow the user to change the background color
of the webpage, or to add a paragraph with some information that the user has just written
in some textfield (like a post in Twitter), etc. Javascript is a language that is used for these
tasks involved in changing something in the webpage. These are sometimes 
called dynamic effects because they allow to change
the content and presentation of a webpage according to the logic that the
programmer wants. Webpages that use Javascript are thus sometimes
called dynamic webpages. In contrast, webpages that use just HTML and CSS are
called static webpages.
</p>
<p>
Javascript instructions are usually stored in text files with extension <b>js</b>.          
For example, a file named <b>example.js</b> would be a Javascript file.               
When we create an HTML file whose contents we want to control                
via Javascript, we need to tell the browser the path to the 
Javascript file that we want to use. We do this by means of the <b>script</b> element. Let's see it
  with an example: take a look at the following webpage, written in a file named
  <b>exampleForAzu.html</b>. This file defines four buttons, one that should
  change the webpage background color to red when clicked on, another to change
  it to green, another to blue, and another to white:
<pre>
&lt;!doctype html&gt;
&lt;html&gt;
  &lt;head&gt;
    &lt;title&gt;Azu is learning Javascript!&lt;/title&gt;
    &lt;script src="javascript4azu.js" defer&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
    &lt;link rel="stylesheet" href="css4azu.css"&gt;
  &lt;/head&gt;
  &lt;body&gt;
    &lt;input type='button' id="buttonForRed" value="Click here to change background to red"&gt;
    &lt;input type='button' id="buttonForGreen" value="Click here to change background to green"&gt;
    &lt;input type='button' id="buttonForBlue" value="Click here to change background to blue"&gt;
    &lt;input type='button' id="buttonForWhite" value="Click here to change background to white"&gt; 
  &lt;/body&gt;ic variables can be incremented 
&lt;/html&gt;
</pre>
<p>
In the above HTML file, we declare the doctype (which indicates that we intend
to use standard HTML), then the html element that contains the whole webpage, and inside
it, two elements: the element head, and the element body.
The element head, as we saw in previous lessons, contains information that is not directly
  shown to the user: in this example they are the title,
  a <b>script</b> element that indicates that we want to use a file named javascript4azu.js with
  Javascript code that we will use to make sure that the buttons allow to change the background color; and 
  a <b>link</b> element referencing a CSS file named css4azu.css that would contain style instructions.
  Then, the element <b>body</b> contains everything that
will be shown to the user in the webpage: in this example, it is just four
buttons. We gave a unique ID to each one: the first button has an id of <b>buttonForRed</b>, 
and on it we write the phrase "Click here to change background to red"; when the user clicks
on it, we want the background color of the entire webpage to turn to red; we will do that using code
that we will write inside the Javascript file. The other three buttons are similar: one 
  uses green, another blue, and the last one, white, which is usually the default color of any webpage background.
</p>
<p>
  One important aspect of the <b>script</b> element is that it has a closing tag, and that nothing is written
  between the opening tag and the closing tag. This is in contrast to the <b>link</b> element
  that we use to indicate a CSS file, which does not have a closing tag.
</p>
<p>
The <b>script</b> opening tag has the optional attribute <b>defer</b>, which means that we want the browser
  to finish downloading the entire html file before attempting to process the Javascript file (i.e., the browser
  <em>defers</em> the processing of the javascript file until the html file has been downloaded).
  In general, it is recommended to write it, due to the following: the browser starts reading the html file
  at the beginning of the file, and processes it line by line. Take a look at the example: first, the browser
  processes the doctype, and then the opening tags
  of the html and head elements. Then, the title element, and then the script element referencing the
  Javascript file. Then, before continuing processing the link element that appears in the next line, it reads the entire Javascript file,
  and only when it finishes processing the Javascript file it will continue processing the html file, starting
  with the link element, then the closing head tag, and then the body element. The important part to notice here is that
  when the browser reads the Javascript file, it still did not read the four buttons that the Javascript file will manage (and
  that is because they are written in the html file AFTER the script element that references the Javascript file). And, since the whole point of the Javascript file
  is to control those four buttons, the browser may get confused if we attempt to do anything
  related to those buttons inside the Javascript file because it still did not see them. To make sure that the browser knows about the existence
  of the buttons when we try to control them with Javascript, it is better to <b>defer</b> the reading of the
  contents of the Javascript file until the entire HTML file has been processed (so the browser has alredy
  seen the buttons and everything else inside the webpage). That is why we write defer in the script opening tag.
</p>
<h1>Javascript Vocabulary</h1>
<p>
 Now let's see how to write the Javascript file <b>example4azu.js</b>. Let's start with 
  some <b>Javascript vocabulary and grammar</b>.
</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    The word <b>document</b> in lowercase means the entire webpage. NOTE: Javascript, in contrast to HTML and CSS,
    is case sensitive: the words document, Document, dOcUmEnT, etc., are all different.
  </li>
  <li>
    A dot between two words without spaces ---like in <b>totoro.tail</b>---- means that whatever 
    word is on the right of the dot is applied to whatever is on the left. In the example before, that means the tail
    of the entity called totoro. You can think of the dot between two words as
    an apostrophe s in English.
  </li>
  <li>
    The expression <b>document.title</b> can be read as "document's title", and it means the title of the webpage.
  </li>
  <li>
    The expression <b>document.body</b> means all the HTML elements that we write inside the <b>body</b> tag
    in the HTML file.
  </li>
  <li>
    The word <b>getElementById</b> followed by a string between parentheses, like in <b>getElementById("buttonForRed")</b>
    means the HTML element whose id is the word in the parentheses. In the example HTML file above (the one called exampleForAzu.html)
    it would be the button whose id is buttonForRed.
  </li>
  <li>
    The word <b>style</b> means the set of CSS styling attributes of an HTML element, like color, background color, padding, etc.
  </li>
  <li>
    The word <b>backgroundColor</b> means the background color of some element. It is usually used jointly with the style keyword,
    like in <b>style.backgroundColor</b>.
  </li>
  <li>
    The equal sign is used to assign something a value. For example, the following would change the background color of the
    HTML element called "buttonForRed" to pink:
    <pre>
    document.getElementById("buttonForRed").style.backgroundColor = "pink"
    </pre>
    The above is read by the browser as: "get the document, and inside it the element whose id is buttonForRed, and from its
    style properties, change the background color to pink".
  </li>  
  <li> 
    In Javascript, any word or series of words that instruct the browser to do something is called an statement. For example,
    </b>document.getElementById("buttonForRed").style.backgroundColor = "pink"</b> is an statement because it tells the
    browser to do something. Is is customary, although not mandatory, to write a semicolon after each statement in Javascript,
    For example, instead of 
    <pre>
     document.getElementById("buttonForRed").style.backgroundColor = "pink"
    </pre>
    it is recommended to write
    <pre>
     document.getElementById("buttonForRed").style.backgroundColor = "pink";
    </pre>
  </li>
  <li>
    In Javascript, any word or words that have any value is called an expression. For example, the word
    <b>document</b> is an expression; the series of words
    <b>document.getElementById("buttonForRed").style.backgroundColor</b> is also an expression;
    the word <b>"pink"</b> is also an expression too.
  </li>
  <li>
    Javascript expressions are somewhat equivalent to anything that can be the subject in a normal language like English
    or Spanish. Javascript statements are equivalent to complete sentences, because they have a verb that indicates an action. <br>
    For example,
    <b>document.getElementById("buttonForRed").style.backgroundColor</b> means "the background color of the element
    named buttonForRed", which can be the subject of an English sentence, but not a complete sentence. The word <b>"pink"</b> can also be the
    subject of an English sentence, but not a complete sentence. In contrasst, the following expression 
    <pre>
      document.getElementById("buttonForRed").style.backgroundColor = "pink";
    </pre>
    is equivalent to a complete English sentence because it involves an assignment, which is a verb: the expression
    means "CHANGE to pink the background color of the element whose id is buttonForRed".
  </li>
  <li>
    The word <b>innerHTML</b> means whatever is written in between
    the opening and closing tags of a given HTML element. For example, if we have 
    a paragraph written like this: <b>&lt;p&gt;Hola caracola&lt;/p&gt;</b>,
    then its innerHTML would be <b>Hola caracola</b>. This is, everything written between 
    the opening and closing <b>p</b> tags will be
    its innerHTML.
  </li>
  <li>
    To append some text to a HTML text element, like a paragraph, or a list item, 
    Javascript uses a plus sign followed, without spaces, by an equal sign, followed by the text
    to be appended. For example, the following code appends the phrase <em>El cuento de la buena pipa.</em>
    to the element whose id is <em>parrafoSobreBurgos</em>:
    <pre>document.getElementById("parrafoSobreBurgos").innerHTML += "El cuento de la buena pipa."</pre>
  </li>
  <li>
    The previous point showed how to APPEND to a paragraph. If we want to REPLACE instead of appending,
    we would use just a equal sign. For example, the following replaces whatever is in the element
    whose id is <em>parrafoSobrteBurgos</em> with the phrase <em>El cuento de la buena pipa</em>
    <pre>document.getElementById("parrafoSobreBurgos").innerHTML = "El cuento de la buena pipa."</pre>
  </li>
  <li>
    Javascript can be used to tell the browser to do some action when a condition of some kind occurs. For example, imagine that we
    want to do the following: <em>when the user clicks the button whose id is curiousButton, then the browser should
    change the color of the background of the webpage to blue, and the color of the font of the text of all elements to red,
    and <b>append</b> the phrase "Burgos has a town." to the paragraph whose id is parrafocastilla, and <b>replace</b> the text of the
    paragaph whose id is "parrafogalicia" for the phrase "Galicia has four provinces."</em>
   
    In Javascript, any group of actions that we want to do one after the other is called a <em>function</em>. The Javascript programmer
    is free to choose a name for any function. A function is indicated by the word <b>function</b>, followed by
    the chosen name for the function, two parentheses, and the actions to be done written inside braces. It is usual
    to write one action per line. In the example above, if we choose the name <em>curiousFunction</em> for the actions that
    we described above, we would write:
    <pre>
    function curiousFunction() {
      document.body.style.backgroundColor = "blue";
      document.body.style.color = "red";
      document.getElementById("parrafocastilla").innerHTML += "Burgos has a town.";
      document.getElementById("parrafogalicia").innerHTML = "Galicia has four provinces.";
    }
    </pre>
    IMPORTANT: observe the difference between how we use <b>+=</b> and <b>=</b>: the former appends text to the existing text, 
    and the latter replaces the existing text for new one. Take care with not confusing them.
  </li>
  <li>
    When the browser sees a function like in the previous point (this is, declared using the word <em>function</em>) 
    it does NOT do the actions indicated; it just tells the browser what actions we want to do in the future when
    we desire so. So, when the browser sees the the previous example, the background color would not change, nor would the
    text color, etc. In order for those actions to happen, we need to write somewhere else in the script the name of the function followed by parentheses,
    like this:
    <pre>
       curiousFunction();
    </pre> 
   </li>
  <li>
    In Javascript, the word <b>onclick</b> means the actions that happen when the user clicks on a given element. For example,
    if we write the following inside a Javascript file:
    <pre>
      document.getElementById("curiousButton").onclick = curiousFunction;
    </pre>
    it means that we are telling the browser that, when the user clicks on the webpage's element whose id is 
    <em>curiousButton</em>, it should do the actions written inside the function called <em>curiousFunction</em>. 
    When the browser reads the previous line, it does not do those actions: it will only do them when the user clicks on the button.
    It is important to note that there are not parentheses after the name <em>curiousFunction</em>; if there were, the
    actions would be done when the browser reads that line (but it would be incorrect, so do not put parentheses there).
  </li>
  <li>
    In Javascript, three equal signs one after the other without blank spaces in between them, mean the question <em>is?</em>,
    For example, the expression <em>document.title === "Galicia"</em> means <em>is the document's title Galicia?</em>.
  </li>
  <li>
    If you want to do something only if something else is true, you can use what is called an <b>if</b> statement. For example,
    if you want to change the background color of the webpage to blue ONLY if the current webpage title is <em>Galicia</em>, you
    can write the following:
    <pre>
      if (document.title === "Galicia") {
          document.body.style.backgroundColor = "blue";
      }
    </pre>
  </li>
  <li>
    If you want to do something ONLY if something else is true, and in addition you also want to do a third thing if that other thing is
    false, you can use what is called an <em>if/else</em> statement. For example, if you want to change the background color to blue
    if the title is Galicia, and change it to green if the title is not Galicia, you can write:
    <pre>
      if (document.title === "Galicia") {
          document.body.style.backgroundColor = "blue";
      } else {
          document.body.style.backgroundColor = "green";
      }
    </pre>
  </li>
  <li>
    If you want to do different things depending on the value of something, you can use what is called 
    an <em>if/elseif</em> statement. For example, if you want to change the background color to blue
    if the title is Galicia, and change it to green if the title is Asturias, and to red if it is Castilla, and
    to magenta if the title is Cantabria, and to white in any other case, you can write:
    <pre>
      if (document.title === "Galicia") {
          document.body.style.backgroundColor = "blue";
      } else if (document.title === "Asturias") {
          document.body.style.backgroundColor = "green";
      } else if (document.title === "Castilla") {
          document.body.style.backgroundColor = "red";
      } else if (document.title === "Cantabria") {
          document.body.style.backgroundColor = "magenta";
      } else {
          document.body.style.backgroundColor = "white";
      }
    </pre>
    You can write as many <em>} else if ... </em> lines as needed.
    The previous code can be read as: if the webpage's title is Galicia, change its background color to blue; if it is Asturias, to green,
    if it is Castilla, to red, if it is Cantabria, to magenta, and if it was not any of those cases, to white.
  </li>
  <li>
    In a Javascript file, anything is written between the strings <em>/*</em> and <em>*/</em>, is ignored
    by the browser. That is called a comment, and it is usually used to give information for the
    human reader of the file: author information, copyright notice, an observation that may be useful for
    the future reader of the file, etc. In addition, anything inside
    a line that appears between <b>//</b> and the
    end of the line is also a comment. For example:
    <pre>
     /*Hello everybody: 
       this file was created by the cookie monster
       Copyright hold by Tedio Plomez Sopor*/
     document.body.style.backgroundColor = "magenta"; /* we choose magenta because we like it*/
     // This is a useless comment; improve later!
     let contador_de_gatos = 100; // this counts kittens 
    </pre>
  </li>
  <li>
    In Javascript, you have access to space to store pieces of data that you may want to use inside a webpage.
    You can assign any name to any piece of data, and give it whatever value you want. You can also reassign
    the values as many times as you want. Thus, these pieces of data are called <b>variables</b>.
    For example, if your webpage wants to show information about a city, you can have a variable
    named <em>city_name</em>, whose value is the name <em>Tokyo</em>, and another variable
    named <em>part_of_the_world</em>, whose value is the phrase <em>East Asia</em>, and another variable
    named <em>population</em>, whose value is the <b>number</b> <em>40000000</em> (number
    basically means that we may want to do mathematical operations on it later in the Javascript file), and another variable
    named <em>lottery_number</em>, whose value is the <b>set of characters</b> <em>40000000</em>, which means
    40 million, but we do not want to trear as a number, but rather as a name (so no mathematical operations on it), and another variable
    named <em>famous_neighborhoods</em>, whose value is the set of values <em>Minato, Chuo, Shinagawa, Shibuya, Shinjuku</em>, and another variable
    named <em>is_country_capital</em>, whose value is the truth value <em>true</em>. Names are written between quotes;
    numbers, if we want to do mathematical operations with them later, are written without quotes, and with quotes
    if we do not want so; sets of values are also called arrays, and are written between squate brackets, with a comma separating each value.
    Truth values are called booleans (in honor of Gorge Boole, an English logician) and can be either true or false.
    Each piece of data is written using the word <b>let</b> followed by the name, an equal sign, and the value, like this:
    <pre>
      let city_name = "Tokyo"; /* This variable value is a name, so it uses quotes */
      let part_of_the_world = "East Asia";  /* This value is a phrase, so it uses quotes */
      let population = 40000000; /* This is a number that admits mathematical operations, so it does not use quotes */
      let lottery_number = "40000000"; /* This is a number that does not admit mathematical operations, so it uses quotes */
      let famous_neighborhoods = [ "Minato", "Chuo", "Shinagawa", "Shibuya", "Shinjuku" ]; /* this is an array of variables */
      let is_country_capital = true; /* This is a boolean, so it does not use quotes */
    </pre>
    Variable names can contain letters, numbers, and underscores. The first character must not be a number. 
    It is possible to change the value of any of these pieces of data at any point inside the Javascript file, for example:
    <pre>
      ...
      population += 10000000; /* population changes from 40 million to 50 million */
      famous_neighborhoods += [ "Akasaka" ]; /* the array, which had 5 elements until here, is extended with the new value Akasaka, so it now has 6 elements */ 
    </pre>
    
  </li>
  <li>
    Javascript offers a tool called <em>loops</em> to control how many times some action is done. One of the
    most useful loops is called the <em>for loop</em>. Let's see it with an example. Let's assume that there is
    inside the HTML file an element whose id is <em>paragraph_about_cats</em>. In it, we want to write 100 phrases, in the following
    style:
    <pre>
      There are 1 cats in the bed.
      There are 2 cats in the bed.
      There are 3 cats in the bed.
      ....
      There are 98 cats in the bed.
      There are 99 cats in the bed.
      There are 100 cats in the bed.
    </pre>
    We can write the above directly inside the HTML file, but is is going to take a lot of work (100 lines to be written).
    Instead, we can see that there is an easy pattern in those phrases: all phrases have exactly the same format, and 
    only the number changes in each one, from 1 to 100. This is a clear pattern; and <b>for loops</b> are designed
    to create patterns. In this case, we can write inside the Javascript file the following:     
    <pre>
    for (let number_cats = 1; number_cats <= 100; number_cats = number_cats + 1) {
       document.getElementById("paragraph_about_cats").innerHTML += "There are " + number_cats + "cats in the bed.";
    }
    </pre>
    The for loop has the word <em>for</em> followed by, between parentheses, three statements separated by semicolons, and one
    or more statements between braces. The first statement inside the parentheses (in this example, <em>let number_cats = 1;</em>) 
    declares a variable that we named number_cats;
    this first statement is called the initialization statement of the for loop: the browser runs the initialization
    statement once and only once, at the beginning of the processing of the for loop; in this case, the variable number_cats
    is assigned a numeric value of one; as this does not have quotes, it means that we can perform mathematical operations
    on this variable, which will be adding one by one in order to change its value from 1 to 2, then to 3, then to 4, and all
    the way to 100.<br>
    The for loop has a second statement, in this case, <em>number_cats <= 100;</em>. This is called the termination statement:
    the browser, after running whatever we wrote between the braces, checks if the termination statement is correct; in this
    case, whether the variable number_cats is lower than or equal to 100. If that is false, it stops processing the for loop,
    and continues processing wahtever is written in the Javascript file after the closing brace of the for loop;
    if it is true, it continues repeating whatever is inside the braces of the for loop from the beginning. <br> 
    The third statement inside the parentheses is called the increment statement; in this case,
    it is <em>number_cats = number_cats + 1</em>. The browser runs the increment statement after finishing each repetition 
    of the lines between the braces. So, in this case, we can translate to English the above example like: initialize
    a variable called number_cats to the number 1, and then append to the HTML element called paragraph_about_cats the phrase <em>There are </em> followed
    by the value of the variable number_cats (which is 1), followed by the phrase <em>cats in the bed.</em>; 
    then increment number_cats by one (so it becomes the number 2); 
    then check whether number_cats is less than or equal to 100; if that is false; finish the for loop; else, append, to the HTML element
    called paragraph_about_cats the phrase <em>There are </em> followed by the value of the variable number_cats (which is 2), 
    followed by the phrase <em>cats in the bed.</em>; then increment number_cats by one (so it becomes 3); then 
    check whether number_cats is less than or equal to 100; if that is false; finish the for loop; else, append, to the HTML element
    called paragraph_about_cats the phrase <em>There are </em> followed by the value of the variable number_cats (which is 3), etc.
    We can see that this will append the phrases "There are N cats in the bed." until N is incremented from 100 to 101, at which
    point the check for whether number_cats is less than or equal to 100 will fail, so the browser will stop the for loop and stop
    adding phrases with numbers.
  </li>
  <li>
    Javascript also has another kind of loop called the <b>while loop</b>. It is equivalent to the for loop, but not as expressive.
    For example, to do the previous example with a while loop we would write:
    <pre>
    let number_cats = 1;
    while (number_cats <= 100) {
           document.getElementById("paragraph_about_cats").innerHTML += "There are " + number_cats + "cats in the bed.";
           number_cats = number_cats + 1;
    }
    </pre>
    The previous can be read in English as: create a variable named number_cats and set it to the number 1; then, while the value of
    number_cats is lower than or equal to 100, append to the element whose id is paragraph_abouty_cats the phrase <em>There are </em> plus 
    the value of the variable number_cats plus
    the phrase <em>cats in the bed.</em> and then increase the value of the variable number_cats by one.
  </li>
  <li>
  There is another loop called <b>do while loop</b> that is written
  <pre>
  let number_cats = 1;
  do {
           document.getElementById("paragraph_about_cats").innerHTML += "There are " + number_cats + "cats in the bed.";
           number_cats = number_cats + 1;
  } while (number_cats <= 100);
  </pre>
  This is read: declare a variable named number_cats and initialize its value to 1, and then, do whatever is in the braces, and then check
  if number_cats is lower than or equal to 100; if it is so, do the actions between brackets again, othrwise, stop the loop. The difference
  of this <b>do while loop</b> with the <b>while loop</b> is that the former always does the actions between brackets at least once (because
  the termination check is written AFTER the brackets) while the latter may not run the actions between the brackets if the termination check
  fails (because it is written BEFORE the brackets).

   In mathematical operations, the percentage sign, like in <em>17 % 5</em> means the remainder of dividing 17 by 5 (in this case,
   the remainder is 2). If you see something like <em>x % y</em> that means the remainder left after dividing x by y. It is common
   to see the remainder in Javascript when checking if a number <em>x</em> is even or odd: if the remainder of dividing x by 2 is
   0, then <em>x</em> is even, else it is odd. For example, imagine that we want to check if the number 12345678 is even or odd, and if
   it is even, we want to set the background color of the webpage to blue, and to red if it is odd. We would be
   able to do that in the following way:
   <pre>
   if (es_par_este_numero(12345678) === true) {
      document.body.style.backgroundColor = "blue";
   } else {   
      document.body.style.backgroundColor = "red";
   }
   
   function es_par_este_numero(x) {
      if ( (x % 2) === 0 ) {
        return true;
      } else {
        return false;
      }
   }
   </pre>
   Observe how we created a function named <em>es_par_este_numero</em> that contains
   the code that will check whether the number is even or odd. In order to be semantically and
   grammatically reasonable, we want that function to be named adequately in order to allow
   the reader to understand in an English-like manner the meaning of the first line, where we 
   use the function jointly with the if. Thus, the first line can be read as something like: if it is true that the number 1345678 is even, 
   then change the background color of the webpage to blue, else to red. We can describe the function as being boolean
   because it can be true or false when we give it a number between the parentheses (anything that
   the function needs goes inside the parentheses, and it is called a parameter of the function). For example,
   <em>es_par_este_numero(12)</em> would be true, while <em>es_par_este_numero(13)</em> would be false.
   The boolean value of the function is indicated inside the function using the word <b>return</b> followed
   by that value.<br>
   We write the instructions that check whether the number is even or odd between the braces of the function statement,
   between lines 7 and 13. These instructions are called the implementation of the function. In the implementation,
   we use an indetifier of our choice to represent the number; in this
   case, we choose to call it <em>x</em> because it is short and x is usually used to represent numbers. 
   The implementation of the function checks whether the remainder of dividing x by 2 is zero,
   and if that is true, the function finishes by writing <em>return true;</em> since we want the function
   to say that it is true that the number is even (an if the remainder is not zero, then the number is not even, so
   we return a value of false to whover called the function). That means that whoever called
   the function can know that the number is even, or odd.

   Javascript functions can have multiple parameters, as many as needed to do whatever it is that
   the function does; and can return any kind of information. In the previous example, the function
   <em>es_par_este_numero</em> needed to return either true or false because we designed it that way.
   Let`s see an example of a function that returns a number: imagine that we have a function 
   named <em>suma_cinco_numeros</em> that adds 5 numbers that we provide.
   We can use the following code to print inside an HTML element whose id is <em>silly_paragraph</em> the sum of the
   numbers 10,30,15,60,100 (just a random example):
   <pre>
     document.getElementById("silly_paragraph").innerHTML = "The sum of the numbers is: " + suma_cinco_numeros(10, 30, 15, 60, 100);
     function suma_cinco_numeros(n1, n2, n3, n4, n5) {
       let resultado = n1 + n2 + n3 + n4 + n5;
       return resultado;
     }
   </pre>
  </li>
  <li>
   In Javascript we can use a timer to run a function after a given number of milliseconds after the webpage is loaded. For example,
   the following would run the function <em>change_background_to_blue</em> after 10 seconds (10 thousand milliseconds):
   <pre>
   setTimeout(change_background_to_blue, 10000);
   function change_background_to_blue() {
     document.body.style.backgroundColor = "blue";
   }
   </pre>
  </li>
  <li>
  Numeric variables can be incremented in different ways:
  <pre>
   let i = 100; /* This declares a variable named i, whose value is 100 */
   i = i + 1; /* This adds 1 to the value of i and stores the value in i; so i becomes 101 */
   i++; /* This is equivalent to the above line, i.e., shorthand for i = i+1; so i becomes 102*/
   i = i + 5; /* This adds 5 to i, so i becomes 107 */
   i += 10; /* This adds 10 to i, so i becomes 117 */
   i = i - 100; /* This subtracts 100 from i, so i becomes 17 */
   i -= 7; /* This is another way to subtract: it subtracts 7 from i, so i becomes 10 */
   i = i * 2 ; /* This multiplies i by 2 and stores the value in i, so i becomes 20 */
   i *= 3; /* This multiples i by 3, so i becomes 60 */
   i = i / 3; /* This divides i by 3, so i becomes 20 */
   i /= 5; /* This divides i by 5, so i becomes 4 */
   
   let j = 2; /* This declares a variable named j with a value of 2 */
   let k = j * i; /* This declares a variable named k whose value is the multiplication of the values of the variables i and j, so k becomes 8 */
   let x = 17 % 5; /* This does the integer division of 12 by 5 and sets x as the remainder of that division (in this case 2) */
  </pre>
