Javascript is a language that is used to tell the browser                      
what to do with the HTML elements that we write in the html files              
and how to modify those elements, delete those elements, or create new elements, if needed.                
For example, if we want to put inside an html file a button that, when pressed, allows             
to change the background color of the page, we would use Javascript;           
or, if we want to move an image from its current position, wherever that
may be, to another random psosition in the screen whenever the user moves the mouse over it (like in            
a game of cat and mouse), we would use also Javascript. Or, if                 
we want to connect to another website each fifteen minutes in order to download some             
information (for example, news headlines from the webpage of our favorite
newspaper), and then write those headlines somewhere in the text of the webpage, 
we would also use Javascript.
                                                                                
Javascript instructions are usually stored in text files with extension "js".          
For example, a file named example.js would be a Javascript file.               
When writing an HTML file whose content we will like to control                
via Javascript, we need to indicate to the browser                             
the path to the javascript file that we want to use, in the following          
way:                                                                          
<script src="whatever-path-to-the-js-file" defer></script>                     

So we use an HTML tag named <b>script</b>, and that needs to be close with its
closing tag <b>/script<b>, where its src attribute contains the path to the location of the               
js file, and the attribute "defer" means that you want the browser             
to wait (i.e., defer further action) until it has downloaded                   
the entire webpage before running                                              
whatever instructions you have put in the Javascript file. The attribute defer is optional,
but it is recommended just in case the browser starts doing whatever we tell it to do
inside the Javascript file to elements that still have not been downloaded, so the browser
may get confused about what to do.
                                                                                
For example, if you see the following code inside an HTML file                     
 <title>Example</title>                                                         
 <html>
   <head>
     <link src="thingies/stuff/stylenumber1.css">                                   
     <link src="thingamajig/someweirdstyle.css">                                    
     <script src="morestuff/something.js" defer></script>                           
     <script src="blabla/prrr/something2.js"></script>                              
     <script src="interestingeffectsjs" defer></script>                             
     
    
 that means that:                                                               
 1) the html webpage will get its CSS instructions                              
 from two files: one named stylenumber1.css that is inside a folder named       
 stuff that is inside a folder named thingies, which is in the same             
 folder as the html file itself; and another named someweirdstyle.vss           
 located in a folder named thingamajig that is in the same folder as the        
 html file                                                                      
 2) the html webpage will get its Javascript instructions from three            
 files:                                                                         
  a) one located in a file named something.js located in a folder named         
     morestuff located in the same folder as the html file                      
     and whose instructions need to wait to be executed until the browser       
     has finished downloading all the page info (this is because we wrote the attribute defer),                                
  b) from another named something2.js located in a folder named                 
     prrr which is inside a folder named blabla located inside the same         
     folder as the html file, and whose instructions do not need to wait        
     until the downloading of the HTML file (because it does not have the       
     defer attribute, and thus would be executed immediately once the          
     browser sees that line in the HTML file), and                               
  c) from another called interestingeffects.js located inside the same          
     folder as the HTML file, and whose instructions need to wait until         
     the browser has finished downloading the entire html webpage.              
                                                                                
 In general, most html files that we write will only include just one css file, and just 
 one Javascript file.                                                                          
                                                                                
 Let's now see how to use the Javascript language to command the browser            
 to do something that we want it to do.                  
   
 In Javascript, the word <b>document</b> means the entire webpage:                     
 In Javascript, the expression <b>document.getElementById("holaazu")</b> means to      
 get the webpage, and inside it (the dot means to go inside), get              
 the HTML element with the id "holaazu". That element could be                  
 a paragraph, a header, a list, an image, a div, etc.). For example,            
 document.getElementById("bocadillo")                                            
 means to get the element whose id is "bocadillo". If that element does         
 not exist, then the browser will not do anything. Otherwise, it will           
 do whatever we indicate later.                                                 
 
 For example, imagine that we want to create a webpage with three               
 buttons:                                                                       
 1) one whose id we choose to be: redbutton, with the text 'Pulse here to change to red'      
    and that, when the user clicks on it, the background color of the           
    entire webpage changes to red.                                              
 2) one whose id we choose to be: greenbutton, with the text 'Pulse here to change to green'  
    and that, when the user clicks on it, the background color of the           
    entire webpage changes to green.                                            
 3) one whose id we choose to be: bluebutton, with the text 'Pulse here to change to blue'    
    and that, when the user clicks on it, the background color of the           
    entire webpage changes to blue.                                             
 When any page loads, the background color is white, because                    
 that is color that most browsers use by default. Thus, we will use these three            
 buttons to change the background color of the page. In order to tell the                   
 browser to change the background color to red when a user clicks it,           
 we write in the Javascript file as follows:                                    
                                                                                
Document.getElementById("redbutton").onclick = change_to_red_background;        
function change_to_red_background() {                                           
  Document.body.style.backgroundColor = "red";                                  
}                                
 In Javascript, lines that have equal signs (called assignments) usually
 end in a semicolon; it is optional, but it is recommended practice to
 write it. Javascript is a case sensitive language: the word document, which
 means the webpage, is not the same as the word Document, or DOCUMENT, or other
 variations, which do not have any predefined meaning in the language. Care
 should be taken when writing Javascript programs regarding the case of the words,
 because it is a common source of errors.
 The first line has an equal sign. Lines with an equal sign are                 
 easier to understand by reading the left part backwards, and then              
 the right part. So, in this example, we can read that line as:                 
 when the user clicks (indicate via the word 'onclick', which is a              
 special word in the Javascript language that means 'a user clicks')            
 on the element whose id is redbutton (indicated via the word getElementById    
 and the label 'redbutton' that we freely assigned to the button inside         
 the html file) inside the webpoage (indicated via the word Document, which     
 means the webpage in Javascript), then execute the instruction named           
 change_to_red_background, which is a name that we just invented. This          
 invented name is called a function, and it basically is a series of            
 Javascript sentences that we need to create in order to do whatever            
 it is that we want to do when the user clicks in the button: in this           
 case, it is changing the background color to red. We selected the              
 name change_to_red_backrgound because it is expressive of what the             
 function does, which is the recommended way; however, it could have            
 any other name, like function123, or tonto_el_que_lo_lea, and it               
 would be correct as well. It is considered a good programming         
 practice to use names that are expressive of what the function does, and       
 that usually means using a verb followed by distinctive characteristics:       
 in this case: change_to_red_background. The choice of separating the           
 words via underscores is optional; each programmer has its own style:          
 an alternative option is camel case, like: changeToRedBackground. Use whatever       
 you prefer.                                
    
 In summary, the first line tells the browser "when a user clicks on the element         
 whose id is redbutton, do the instructions contained in the function           
 named change_to_red_background". So now, the only thing remaining is           
 to create that function and use to tell the browser to change the              
 page background color to red. That is done by the lines:                       
 function change_to_red_background()                                            
  document.body.style.backgroundColor = "red";                                  
 }                                                                              
 The first line tells Javascript that we are about to say what is exactly            
 the change_to_red_background function that we referenced before.               
 The function can be anywhere in the Javascript document, it does               
 not have to be following the line with the onclick isntruction.                
 The function is defined with the word function, then the name that             
 we selected, two parentheses that may not have anything between them,          
 or may have something (we will see that later), and then the function          
 instructions between braces {}. It is common to indent the instructions
 inside the function with respect to the line with the word function, and
 the closing brace is commonly put at the same level as the letter f in function.
 In our case, the function istructions is just a single one because             
 Javascript allows us to change the background of the webpage with              
 just a single instruction:                          
   document.body.style.backgroundColor = "red";                                    
 This line means that "red" will be the background color of the body            
 element of the HTML page (the body is the entire visible area                  
 of the webpage, and is indicated with the tag <body> in the HTML file,         
 although taht tag is optional, because the browser will act as if it           
 is written even if we do not write it).                       
                                                                                
 So imagine that we have an html file named "example.html" as follows:
 <pre>
 &lt;!doctype HTML&gt;                                                           
&lt;html&gt;                                                                    
&lt;head&gt;                                                                    
&lt;script src="backgroundcolor.js" defer&gt;&lt;/script&gt;                    
&lt;/head&gt;                                                                   
&lt;body&gt;                                                                    
&lt;input type='button' id="redbutton" value="Click here to change to red"&gt;  
&lt;input type='button' id="greenbutton" value="Click here to change to green"&gt;
&lt;input type='button' id="bluebutton" value="Click here to change to blue"&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;                                                                   
&lt;/html&gt;     
 </pre>
 and a Javascript file named "backgroundcolors.js" as follows:
 <pre>
 document.getElementById("redbutton").onclick = change_to_red_background;        
function change_to_red_background() {                                           
  document.body.style.backgroundColor = "red";                                  
}                                                                               
document.getElementById("greenbutton").onclick = change_to_green_background;    
function change_to_green_background() {                                         
  document.body.style.backgroundColor = "green";                                
}                                                                               
document.getElementById("bluebutton").onclick = change_to_blue_background;      
function change_to_blue_background() {                                          
  document.body.style.backgroundColor = "blue";                                 
}                                               
 </pre>
