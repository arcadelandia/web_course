Step 1: you create two folders in the Desltop of your laptop; 
        one named web_programming, and another named 
        web_information. We will use the first for storing
        your programs, and the second to store support material
        from the Internet, for when you are in a place without Internet
        and want to access that material.

Our work will be structured in several lessons. For each lesson, I will
write a document with the information that I want you to know; you will 
save it in your web_information folder so you can always have access to it
even if you do not have Internet coverage.

For each lesson, you will create a new subfolder inside the web_programming folder,
where you will store all the material that you will create. After each lesson,
you will send me the contents of that subfolder for me to check. Then, we will
comment about it.

Bicos!
