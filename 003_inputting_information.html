<title>Azu's web course: Lesson 3: Inputting information.</title>
<p>Hello Azu! This is the thirs lesson on our web programming course. 
  We will learn how to allow users of your website to provide information.
This functionality is the basis for most popular websites: for example, to use
Google Search, you provide a string of text that Google will process to find it
in websites around the Internet. In another example, when you post a video
on Facebook or a photo on Instagram, you provide files that will be stored
in Facebook's computers in order to allow you to see them later.</p>

There are many ways to allow users to provide info inside a webpage. We are going
to learn one of those. There are others that we will see in other lessons.

A comon way to allow users to provide info is to create the web equivalent of
a form. In the paper world, a form has fields that allow you to input your name,
address, date of birth, favorite food, favorite color, a text with your thoughts,
speace to glue a photo or to append it to the form, etc. Each of those fields has
usually a short label explaining what the field is supposed to mean. A web form 
is the equivalent of that: a group of fields that allow you to provide info; each 
of those fields has usually a label next to it that describes what the field is about.
For example, a post in Instagram has usually a label saying "upload file" for you
to upload a file, and a box to enter the text that you want to show with your photo.
That is a form. Facebook does the same. Google Search has a basic form that is 
the space where you type what you want to search, and a button that initiates the
search.

The HTML tag that creates a form is <form>. It usually contains one or more input
  elements; the programmer needs to decide how many of each type of input to
  put, depending on the needs of a website. For example: a text area to put a name, 
  another to put an email, another to select one or more files to upload, another 
  with a checkbox to select any available options, another with a radio button 
  to select one and only one of several options, another with a dropdown menu, etc.
  Often, it is possible to have more than one possibility to allow the user to
  indicate something; subjectivity plays an important role when deciding what to
  put and how to put it.
  
  The idea of having a form is to end up sending that info to the computers hosting the
  webpage, for them to store that information, or process it somehow. In order to control
  this process, the <form> tag needs to indicate two things: first, the name of the 
  webpage that will receive that information; this is controlled by an attribute 
  named "action". Second, it needs to indicate whether the information should be
  stored in the server, or just processed to return some information and then not
  stored; this is controlled by an attribute in the <form> tag called "method": if
  we want the server to store the info, we use a value of "post" for the method; otherwise,
  we use a value of "get". The most common case is that we want to store that data, so
  we will typically use "post". For example, the following lines indicate that there is
  a form (whose fields we still did not write) that, once the user is done with, will
  send its data to a webpage named processmydata.html which exists in the same folder
  as the webpage where the form is written, and that the webpage designer intends to
  store that data so it is available later if needed.

  <form action="processmydata.html" method="post"> 
    .... 
  </form>
  
  There are many ways to allow a user to input information. In a future lesson, we will
  learn how to use those values. Here are some of the most common ones:
  <ol>
    <li> label: this field is used before some input element, to allow the user to know that the field is about. For example, if there
    is a text field where the user is supposed to write an email address, a label saying something like: "Write your email address" will typically
    be present. Each input field will typically have a label, except those that already have labels themselves like buttons.</li>
    <li>text: a one line text field where the user can write whatever they want (e.g., a Google Search field to write what you want to search for).
    </li>
    <li>password: it is a text field, but the characters are hidden as they are typed (used to make it hard for other 
      people to know what is being typed).</li>
    <li>email: this one is a particularization of the text field, that is supposed to ask the computer to make it easier for the 
      user to write the @ symbol; it may or may not be different from a vanilla text field.</li>
    <li>number: this one is another particularization of the text field, that is supposed to tell the computer to make it easier for the user
      to write numbers (for example, in a smartphone it would show the numeric keypad with big numbers rather than the small keypad with 
      letters and numbers). It may or may not be different from a vanilla text field, depending on the browser and the computer.</li>
    <li>tel: this one is another particularization of the text field, that is suposed to make it easier to write phone numbers.</li>
    <li>url: another particularization of a text field, assumed to make it easier to write an URL (for example, the user's favorite website).  
      As with the "email", "number", and "tel", they are not strictly needed, and a vanilla "text" filed can be used for them.</li>
    <li>range: allows the user to control a bar similar to those controlling volume levels, so they can pick a number between a
    minimum and a maximum. This is recommended for items where the exact number is not very important, as long as it is close to the desired one
    (for examplem selecting an audio volume). </li>
    <li>datetime-local: allows the user to select a data and time.</li>
    <li>color: allows the user to pick a color.</li>
    <li>checkbox: allows the user to select any suitable option among several ones shown in the screen at the same time.</li>
    <li>select: allows the user to select any suitable option inside a drop-down menu.</li>
    <li>radio: allows the user to select one and only one option among several ones provided by the programmer.</li>
    
    
    
    
    
  </ol>
