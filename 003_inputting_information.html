<title>Azu's web course: Lesson 3: Inputting information.</title>
<p>Hello Azu! This is the third lesson on our web programming course. 
  We will learn how to allow users of your website to provide information, so
  you are later able to use it in some way, typically to store that information 
  in a database, or to use it to process some existing database according
  to the data that the user sends.
This functionality is the basis for most popular websites: for example, to use
Google Search, you provide a string of text that Google will look for in its
  database. In another example, when you post a video
on Facebook, you provide a video file that will be stored
in Facebook's database in order to allow you to see it later.</p>

<p>
  There are many ways to allow users to provide info inside a webpage. We are going
 to learn one of those, based on what is called an HTML form. There are others that 
  we will see in other lessons.
</p>

<p> An HTML form is the browser equivalent of a paper-based form. In the paper 
  world, a form has fields that allow you to input things like your name,
address, date of birth, favorite food, favorite color, a text with your thoughts,
space to glue a photo or to append it to the form, possibility of attaching a
  DVD with a video or a pdf or anything else, check some box that applies to you, etc. 
  When you need to write something, each of those fields has usually a short 
  label explaining what the field is supposed to mean (e.g., address, name, etc). 
  In an HTML form you have the equivalent of that: the form has a group of fields 
  that allow you to provide info; the HTML programmer decides what fields exist;
  each of those fields has usually a label next to it that describes what the 
  field is about. For example, a post in Instagram has usually a label saying "upload file" for you
to upload a photo, and a box to enter the text that you want to show with your photo.
That is an HTML form. Facebook does the same. Google Search has a basic form that is 
the box where you type what you want to search, plus the button that initiates the
search.
</p>

<p>
The HTML tag that creates a form is <b>form</b>. It usually contains one or more input
  elements; the programmer needs to decide how many of each type of input element to
  put, depending on the needs of the website. For example: a text area to put a name, 
  another to put an email, another to select one or more files to upload, another 
  with a checkbox to select any available options, another with a radio button 
  to select one and only one of several options, another with a dropdown menu, etc.
  Creating forms is more an art than a science, and there are lots of different
  opinions about how to do it; subjectivity plays an important role when creating a form.
  </p>

<p>Let's take a look at the following example:</p>
<pre>
  &lt;form action="processmydata.html" method="post" enctype="multipart/form-data"&gt; 
    .... CONTENT OF THE FORM WOULD BE HERE .... 
  &lt;/form&gt;
 </pre>
<p>  
  The previous example creates a HTML form (whose fields we still did not write); this
  form, once the user is done with it, will send its data to a webpage named 
  processmydata.html which exists in the same folder as the webpage where this form is 
  written. 
</p>

<p>
  The most common purpose of having a form is to send the info that the website user types
  in it, to the computer hosting the webpage. This computer will process and/or store that
  information. In order to control this process, the <b>form</b> tag needs to indicate 
  three things: <b>first</b>, the name of the webpage that will receive that information; this 
  is controlled by an attribute named "action" inside the opening tag of the form; in the
  example above, the page is called processmydata.html (any name would be valid, and the
  programmer will need to create that page; we will learn how to do that in a later lesson).
  <b>Second</b>, it needs to indicate whether the information should be
  stored in the server(for exampke, to store photos like Instagram), or just processed rather than stored (for example, to look for that
  information in a database rather than store tge search term itself, like Google Search does); this is controlled by an attribute 
  called "method" in the opening tag of the form: it can have a value of "post" if we
  want the server to store the info provided in the form; otherwise, we use a value of "get"
  if the info should just be processed but not necessarily stored. 
  The most common case is that we want to store that data, so
  we will typically use "post". In our previous example, we are indicating that we want
  to store that information.
  <b>Third</b>, if what we send in the form includes files (for example, to post photos,
  or videos, or pdfs, etc), we should include the string <em>enctype="multipart/form-data"</em>
  to the form opening tag; this is not strictly needed, but tells the browser to try to
  compress as much as possible the files sent (mnay help clients with low bandwidth)
  </p>

  <p>There are many types of input fields that allow a user to input information. Here are some of the most common ones:</p>
  <ol>
    <li> label: this field is just a text label to tell the user what a field is used for. For example, if there
    is a text field where the user is supposed to write an email address, a label saying something like: "Write your email address" will typically
    be present. Each input field will typically have a label, except those that already have labels themselves like buttons.</li>
    <li>text: a one line text field where the user can write whatever they want (e.g., Google Search uses a text field to allow the user
      to write what they want to search for).
    </li>
    <li>password: it is a text field, but the characters are hidden as they are typed (used to make it hard for other 
      people to know what is being typed).</li>
    <li>email: this one is a particularization of the text field, that is supposed to ask the computer to make it easier for the 
      user to write the @ symbol; it may or may not be different from a vanilla text field, depending on the browser and operating system.</li>
    <li>number: this one is another particularization of the text field, that is supposed to tell the computer to make it easier for the user
      to write numbers (for example, in a smartphone it would show the numeric keypad with big numbers rather than the small keypad with 
      letters and numbers). It may or may not be different from a vanilla text field.</li>
    <li>tel: this one is another particularization of the text field, that is suposed to make it easier to write phone numbers.</li>
    <li>url: another particularization of a text field, assumed to make it easier to write an URL (for example, the user's favorite website).  
      As with the "email", "number", and "tel", they may not have any difference with a text field. Thus, maybe it is easier to
      use text fields for all input elements where users can type text.</li>
    <li>range: allows the user to control a bar similar to those controlling volume levels, so they can pick a number between a
    minimum and a maximum, indicated y the usage of the <em>mim</em> and <em>max</em> attributes. 
      This is recommended for items where the exact number is not very important, as long as it is close to the desired one
    (for example, selecting an audio volume). </li>
    <li>datetime-local: allows the user to select a date and time.</li>
    <li>color: allows the user to pick a color.</li>
    <li>checkbox: allows the user to select any suitable option among several ones shown in the screen at the same time. 
      All the options related to the same group should be given the same name; if any has the attribute <em>checked</em>
    present, it will show checked when the page is loaded.</li>
    <li>select: allows the user to select any suitable option inside a drop-down menu. If the attribute <em>multiple</em> is 
      present in the opening tag, multiple selections are possible.</li>
    <li>radio: allows the user to select one and only one option among several ones provided by the programmer.</li>
    <li>textarea: allows the user to input arbitrary, multi-line, text. This element, in contrast to all the rest, needs a closing tag.</li>
    <li>file: allows the user to upload one or more files. If the attribute "multiple" is present, several files can be selected at the same time.</li>
    <li>reset: this shows a button that allows the user to reset all info inputted up to that moment. This is handy if the user wants to erase
      all information typed.</li>
    <li>submit: this shows a button that allows the user to send all information in the form to the computer hosting the website.</li>
    <li>button: this shows a button without any predefined behavior (e.g., change the color of the background of the form, or check
      the form input to see if something is missing, etc.); when we learn Javascript, we will learn how to deal with these.</li>
  </ol>

  <p>
  Each input tag needs to have an attribute called "name", whose value can be whatever we want, but it is recommended
    to be something short and memorable for the field. This value will be used by the computer we send the data to, in order
    to know which value corresponds to each field (we will see those details in a later lesson). 
    For example, if we would like to create a form
    that allowed the website to collect information like this: 
    "petname=Pipo, phonenumber=12345678, favoritecolor=green, preferredfood=patatillas", then we would need to create
    a form field with a name called petname, another with name phonenumber, another with name favoritecolor,
    and another with name preferredfood.  It could be something like, for example:
    <pre>
    &lt;form action="blablabla.html" method="post"&gt;
    &lt;input type="text" name="petname"&gt;
    &lt;input type="text" name="phonenumber"&gt;
    &lt;input type="text" name="favoritecolor"&gt;
    &lt;input type="text" name="preferredfood"&gt;
    &lt;/form&gt;
    </pre>

  <h1> Miscellaneous HTML programming tips and tricks:</h1>
    <ol>
      <li>When writing a HTML page, it is recommended to indicate which version of the langauge is being used. 
        The current version of HTML is 5.0, and has been this way since 2008.
        This 5.0 version is indicated by writing, as the very first line of the HTML document, the following:
        <b>&lt;!doctype html&gt;</b>. Earlier versions have more complicated ways to do it.
      </li>
      <li>When writing characters that are not present in American English, like tildes in Spanish, it is needed
      to say so explicitly; otherwise, browsers from users in countries whose languages do not have Spanish characters
      will show garbled text. In order to indicate that, we write inside the document:
      <b>&lt;meta charset="utf-8"&gt;</b>
      </li>
      <li>Comments are part of an HTML file that get ignored by the browser. Sometimes we want to include 
        these comments to remind the programmer about why something was done
        in a given way, just in case it gets forgotten in the future. Or sometimes the programmer 
        is writing HTML code that is not yet ready to be shown to the user because it may have bugs, or 
        something similar. In order to include these comments, we write:
      <b>&lt;!-- ANYTHING WRITTEN HERE IS IGNORED BY THE BROWSER --&gt;</b>
      </li>
      <li>To indicate the author of a page, we can use <b>&lt;meta name="author" content="paco y pipo"&gt;</b> </li>
      <li>To indicate any attribute that we may want Google or other search engines to know about, just
        in case it helps in any web search made by people, we can
        use the <em>meta</em> tag using its <em>name</em> and <em>content</em> attributes. For example, if we want to say that
        our webpage is related to cars, and its information is focused on Spain, and on the historical period of the 1230s,
        we could write
        <pre>
        &lt;meta name="theme" content="cars"&gt;
        &lt;meta name="country" content="Spain&gt;
        &lt;meta name="epoch" content="1930s"&gt;
        </pre>
        where we are free to choose the values of the name and content attributes. Whether any web search engine like
        Google will be able to use it is unclear, but the meta tag is designed to help that way.
      </li>
      <li>Old versions of HTML recommended to group all elements of a webpage into two gropus: one formed
      by elements that do not show in the browser (contained inside a <b>&lt;head&gt;</b> tag) 
        and the elements that show (identified by the <b>&lt;body&gt;</b> tag). In addition, they also recommended
        to put all elements inside a tag called <b>html</b>. With HTML5.0 they are not needed,
        but many people continue to put those tags, and they appear in many tutorials. For example, the HTML code:
        <pre>
        &lt;title&gt;Cars and motorbikes&lt;/title&gt;
        &lt;meta charset="utf-8"&gt;
        &lt;meta name="food" content="patatillas;cropanes"&gt;
        &lt;h1>Tasty foods&lt;/h1&gt;
        &lt;p>Patatillas&lt;/p&gt;
        </pre>
        can be written in old HTML style as:
        <pre>g
        &lt;html&gt;
          &lt;head&gt;
            &lt;title>Cars and motorbikes&lt;/title&gt;
            &lt;meta charset="utf-8"&gt;
            &lt;meta name="food" content="patatillas;cropanes"&gt;
          &lt;/head&gt;
          &lt;body&gt;
            &lt;h1&gt;Tasty foods&lt;/h1&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Patatillas&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;body&gt;
        &lt;/html&gt;
        </pre>
        Since not writing the <b>&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;body&gt;</b> tags is simpler than writing them, it is recommended
        to not write them to make things easier. However, many HTML tutorials continue using them, so it is good
        to be aware of their existence.
        </li>
